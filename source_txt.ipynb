    "Little Women is a novel that develops deep and human themes\n",
    "within its interesting plot. Published in 1868, after the American\n",
    "Civil War, it tells the story of 4 sisters: Megan (Meg), Josephine\n",
    "(Jo), Elizabeth (Beth), and Amy. All of them have to live with the\n",
    "detachment of their father and the economic shortages due to\n",
    "the political and social situation of their time.\n",
    "As the novel progresses we see the psychology of each of the\n",

    "‘Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents,’ grumbled\n",
    "Jo, lying on the rug.\n",
    "‘It’s so dreadful to be poor!’ sighed Meg, looking down at her\n",
    "old dress.\n",
    "‘I don’t think it’s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty\n",
    "things, and other girls nothing at all,’ added little Amy, with an\n",
    "injured sniff.\n",
    "‘We’ve got Father and Mother, and each other,’ said Beth\n",
    "contentedly from her corner.\n",
    "The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at\n",
    "the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, ‘We\n",
    "haven’t got Father, and shall not have him for a long time.’ She\n",
    "didn’t say ‘perhaps never,’ but each silently added it, thinking of\n",
    "Father far away, where the fighting was.\n",
    "Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,\n",
    "‘You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents\n",
    "this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for\n",
    "everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for\n",
    "pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can’t\n",
    "do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do\n",
    "it gladly. But I\n",
    "4\n",
    "am afraid I don’t.’ And Meg shook her head, as she thought\n",
    "regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.\n",
    "‘But I don’t think the little we should spend would do any good.\n",
    "We’ve each got a dollar, and the army wouldn’t be much helped\n",
    "by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother\n",
    "or you, but I do want to buy UNDINE AND SINTRAM for myself.\n",
    "I’ve wanted it so long,’ said Jo, who was a bookworm.\n",
    "‘I planned to spend mine in new music,’ said Beth, with a little\n",
    "sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle holder.\n",
    "‘I shall get a nice box of Faber’s drawing pencils. I really need\n",
    "them,’ said Amy decidedly.\n",
    "‘Mother didn’t say anything about our money, and she won’t\n",
    "wish us to give up everything. Let’s each buy what we want, and\n",
    "have a little fun. I’m sure we work hard enough to earn it,’ cried\n",
    "Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\n",
    "‘I know I do—teaching those tiresome children nearly all day,\n",
    "when I’m longing to enjoy myself at home,’ began Meg, in the\n",
    "complaining tone again.\n",
    "‘You don’t have half such a hard time as I do,’ said Jo. ‘How\n",
    "would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old\n",
    "lady, who keeps you trotting, is never\n",
    "5\n",
    "satisfied, and worries you till you you’re ready to fly out the\n",
    "window or cry?’\n",
    "‘It’s naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping\n",
    "things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross,\n",
    "and my hands get so stiff, I can’t practice well at all.’ And Beth\n",
    "looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear\n",
    "that time.\n",
    "‘I don’t believe any of you suffer as I do,’ cried Amy, ‘for you\n",
    "don’t have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague\n",
    "you if you don’t know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses,\n",
    "and label your father if he isn’t rich, and insult you when your\n",
    "nose isn’t nice.’\n",
    "‘If you mean libel, I’d say so, and not talk about labels, as if\n",
    "Papa was a pickle bottle,’ advised Jo, laughing.\n",
    "‘I know what I mean, and you needn’t be statirical about it. It’s\n",
    "proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,’\n",
    "returned Amy, with dignity.\n",
    "‘Don’t peck at one another, children. Don’t you wish we had the\n",
    "money Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy\n",
    "and good we’d be, if we had no worries!’ said Meg, who could\n",
    "remember better times.\n",
    "‘You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier\n",
    "than the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the\n",
    "time, in spite of their money.’\n",
    "6\n",
    "‘So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have to\n",
    "work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo\n",
    "would say.’\n",
    "‘Jo does use such slang words!’ observed Amy, with a reproving\n",
    "look at the long figure stretched on the rug.\n",
    "Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began\n",
    "to whistle.\n",
    "‘Don’t, Jo. It’s so boyish!’ ‘That’s why I do it.’\n",
    "‘I detest rude, unladylike girls!’\n",
    "‘I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!’\n",
    "‘Birds in their little nests agree,’ sang Beth, the peacemaker,\n",
    "with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a\n",
    "laugh, and the ‘pecking’ ended for that time.\n",
    "‘Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,’ said Meg, beginning to\n",
    "lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion.’You are old enough to leave\n",
    "off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn’t\n",
    "matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you are so\n",
    "tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a\n",
    "young lady.’\n",
    "‘I’m not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I’ll wear it in\n",
    "two tails till I’m twenty,’ cried Jo, pulling off her net, and\n",
    "7\n",
    "shaking down a chestnut mane. ‘I hate to think I’ve got to grow\n",
    "up, and be Miss March, and wear\n",
    "long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster! It’s bad enough\n",
    "to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy’s games and work and\n",
    "manners! I can’t get over my disappointment in not being a\n",
    "boy. And it’s worse than ever now, for I’m dying to go and fight\n",
    "with Papa. And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old\n",
    "woman!’\n",
    "And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like\n",
    "castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.\n",
    "‘Poor Jo! It’s too bad, but it can’t be helped. So you must try to\n",
    "be contented with making your name boyish, and playing\n",
    "brother to us girls,’ said Beth, stroking the rough head with a\n",
    "hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could\n",
    "not make ungentle in its touch. ‘As for you, Amy,’ continued\n",
    "Meg, ‘you are altogether\n",
    "to particular and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you’ll grow\n",
    "up an affected little goose, if you don’t take care. I I like your\n",
    "nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don’t try\n",
    "to be elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as Jo’s slang.’\n",
    "‘If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?’ asked\n",
    "Beth, ready to share the lecture.\n",
    "8\n",
    "‘You’re a dear, and nothing else,’ answered Meg warmly, and no\n",
    "one contradicted her, for the ‘Mouse’ was the pet of the family.\n",
    "As young readers like to know ‘how people look’, we will take\n",
    "this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who\n",
    "sat knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell\n",
    "quietly without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a\n",
    "comfortable room, though the carpet was faded and the\n",
    "furniture very plain, for a good picture or two hung on the walls,\n",
    "books filled the recesses, chrysanthemums and Christmas roses\n",
    "bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home\n",
    "peace pervaded it.\n",
    "Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty,\n",
    "being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair,\n",
    "a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain.\n",
    "Fifteen- year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and\n",
    "reminded one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to\n",
    "do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She\n",
    "had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes,\n",
    "which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\n",
    "funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty,\n",
    "but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way.\n",
    "Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to\n",
    "9\n",
    "her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who\n",
    "was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn’t like it.\n",
    "Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smoothhaired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid\n",
    "voice, and a ;peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed.\n",
    "Her father called her ‘Little Miss Tranquility’, and the name\n",
    "suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of\n",
    "her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted\n",
    "and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important\n",
    "person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with\n",
    "blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and\n",
    "slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of\n",
    "her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we\n",
    "will leave to be found out.\n",
    "The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a\n",
    "pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old\n",
    "shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming,\n",
    "and everyone brightened to welcome her. Meg stopped\n",
    "lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair\n",
    "without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was as she\n",
    "sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.\n",
    "‘They are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair.’\n",
    "‘I thought I’d get her some with my dollar,’ said Beth.\n",
    "10\n",
    "‘No, I shall!’ cried Amy.\n",
    "‘I’m the oldest,’ began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, ‘I’m\n",
    "the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the\n",
    "slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while he\n",
    "was gone.’\n",
    "‘I’ll tell you what we’ll do,’ said Beth, ‘let’s each get her\n",
    "something for Christmas, land not get anything for ourselves.’\n",
    "‘That’s like you, dear! What will we get?’ exclaimed Jo. Everyone\n",
    "thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the\n",
    "idea was suggested by the sight of her\n",
    "own pretty hands, ‘I shall give her a nice pair of gloves.’ ‘Army\n",
    "shoes, best to be had,’ cried Jo.\n",
    "‘Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,’ said Beth.\n",
    "‘I’ll get a little bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it won’t cost\n",
    "much, so I’ll have some left to buy my pencils,’ added Amy.\n",
    "‘How will we give the things?’ asked Meg.\n",
    "‘Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the\n",
    "bundles. Don’t you remember how we used to do on our\n",
    "birthdays?’ answered Jo.\n",
    "11\n",
    "‘I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the\n",
    "chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round\n",
    "to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked\n",
    "the things and the kisses, but it was dreadful to have you sit\n",
    "looking at me while I opened the bundles,’ said Beth, who was\n",
    "toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time.\n",
    "‘Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then\n",
    "surprise her. We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg.\n",
    "There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night,’ said\n",
    "Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and\n",
    "her nose in the air.\n",
    "‘I don’t mean to act any more after this time. I’m getting too\n",
    "old for such things,’ observed Meg, who was as much a child as\n",
    "ever about ‘dressing-up’ frolics.\n",
    "‘You won’t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white\n",
    "gown with your hair down, and wear gold- paper jewelry. You\n",
    "are the best actress we’ve got, and there’ll be an end of\n",
    "everything if you quit the boards,’ said Jo. ‘We ought to\n",
    "rehearse tonight. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene,\n",
    "for you are as stiff as a poker in that.’\n",
    "‘I can’t help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don’t choose to\n",
    "make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can\n",
    "12\n",
    "go down easily, I’ll drop. If I can’t, I shall fall into a chair and be\n",
    "graceful. I don’t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,’\n",
    "returned Amy, who was not\n",
    "gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she was\n",
    "small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the\n",
    "piece.\n",
    "‘Do it this way. Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the\n",
    "room, crying frantically, ‘Roderigo Save me! Save me!’ and\n",
    "away went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly\n",
    "thrilling.\n",
    "Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her,\n",
    "and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her\n",
    "‘Ow!’ was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of\n",
    "fear and anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg\n",
    "laughed outright, while Beth let her bread burn as she watched\n",
    "the fun with interest. ‘It’s no use! Do the best you can when the\n",
    "time comes, and if the audience laughs, don’t blame me. Come\n",
    "on, Meg.’\n",
    "‘Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a\n",
    "speech of two pages without a single break. Hagar, the witch,\n",
    "chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering\n",
    "toads, with weird effect. Roderigo rent his chains asunder\n",
    "13\n",
    "manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic,\n",
    "with a wild, ‘Ha! Ha!’\n",
    "‘It’s the best we’ve had yet,’ said Meg, as the dead villain sat up\n",
    "and rubbed his elbows.\n",
    "‘I don’t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.\n",
    "You’re a regular Shakespeare!’ exclaimed Beth, who firmly\n",
    "believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all\n",
    "things.\n",
    "‘Not quite,’ replied Jo modestly. ‘I do think THE WITCHES\n",
    "CURSE, an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I’d like to\n",
    "try McBETH, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo. I always\n",
    "wanted to do the killing part. ‘Is that a dagger that I see before\n",
    "me?’ muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as\n",
    "she had seen a famous tragedian do.\n",
    "‘No, it’s the toasting fork, with Mother’s shoe on it instead of the\n",
    "bread. Beth’s stage-struck!’ cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended\n",
    "in a general burst of laughter.\n",
    "‘Glad to find you so merry, my girls,’ said a cheery voice at the\n",
    "door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall,\n",
    "motherly lady with a ‘can I help you’ look about her which was\n",
    "truly delightful. She was not elegantly dressed, but a noblelooking woman, and the girls thought the gray cloak and\n",
    "14\n",
    "unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the\n",
    "world.\n",
    "‘Well, dearies, how have you got on today? There was so much\n",
    "to do, getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn’t\n",
    "come home to dinner. Has anyone called,\n",
    "Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look tired to death. Come\n",
    "and kiss me, baby.’\n",
    "While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet\n",
    "things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy\n",
    "chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour\n",
    "of her busy day. The girls flew about, trying to make things\n",
    "comfortable, each in her own way. Meg arranged the tea table,\n",
    "Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping, over-turning, and\n",
    "clattering everything she touched. Beth trotted to and fro\n",
    "between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave\n",
    "directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.\n",
    "As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a\n",
    "particularly happy face, ‘I’ve got a treat for you after supper.’\n",
    "A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth\n",
    "clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo\n",
    "tossed up her napkin, crying, ‘A letter! A letter! Three cheers for\n",
    "Father!’\n",
    "15\n",
    "‘Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through\n",
    "the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of\n",
    "loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you\n",
    "girls,’ said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she had got a\n",
    "treasure there.\n",
    "‘Hurry and get done! Don’t stop to quirk your little finger and\n",
    "simper over your plate, Amy,’ cried Jo, choking on her tea and\n",
    "dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste\n",
    "to get at the treat.\n",
    "Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner\n",
    "and brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready.\n",
    "‘I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he\n",
    "was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,’\n",
    "said Meg warmly.\n",
    "‘Don’t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan—what’s its\n",
    "name? Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help him,’\n",
    "exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\n",
    "‘It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts\n",
    "of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,’ sighed Amy.\n",
    "‘When will he come home, Marmee? asked Beth, with a little\n",
    "quiver in her voice.\n",
    "16\n",
    "‘Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and\n",
    "do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won’t ask for\n",
    "him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come\n",
    "and hear the letter.’\n",
    "They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her\n",
    "feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of\n",
    "the chair, and Jo leaning on the back, where no one would see\n",
    "any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching.\n",
    "Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not\n",
    "touching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one\n",
    "little was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or\n",
    "the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful, hopeful letter,\n",
    "full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military\n",
    "news, and only at the end did the writer’s heart over-flow with\n",
    "fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.\n",
    "‘Give them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of\n",
    "them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort\n",
    "in their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait\n",
    "before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may\n",
    "all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted. I know\n",
    "they will remember all I said to them, that they will be loving\n",
    "children to you, will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom\n",
    "enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so beautifully that\n",
    "17\n",
    "when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder than\n",
    "ever of my little women.’ Everybody sniffed when they came to\n",
    "that part. Jo wasn’t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off\n",
    "the end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her\n",
    "curls as she hid her face on her mother’s\n",
    "shoulder and sobbed out, ‘I am a selfish girl! But I’ll truly try to\n",
    "be better, so he mayn’t be disappointed in me by- and-by.’\n",
    "We all will,’ cried Meg. ‘I think too much of my looks and hate to\n",
    "work, but won’t any more, if I can help it.’\n",
    "‘I’ll try and be what he loves to call me, ‘a little woman’ and not\n",
    "be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to\n",
    "be somewhere else,’ said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper\n",
    "at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two\n",
    "down South.\n",
    "Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army\n",
    "sock and began to knit with all her might, losing no time in\n",
    "doing the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her\n",
    "quiet little soul to be all that Father hoped to find her when the\n",
    "year brought round the happy coming home.\n",
    "Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo’s words, by saying\n",
    "in her cheery voice, ‘Do you remember how you used to play\n",
    "Pilgrims Progress when you were little things? Nothing delighted\n",
    "18\n",
    "you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for\n",
    "burdens, give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you\n",
    "travel through the house from the cellar, which was the City of\n",
    "Destruction,\n",
    "up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you\n",
    "could collect to make a Celestial City.’\n",
    "‘What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon,\n",
    "and passing through the valley where the hob- goblins were,’\n",
    "said Jo.\n",
    "‘I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled\n",
    "downstairs,’ said Meg.\n",
    "‘I don’t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of\n",
    "the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk\n",
    "we had up at the top. If I wasn’t too old for such things, I’d\n",
    "rather like to play it over again,’ said Amy, who began to talk of\n",
    "renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve.\n",
    "‘We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we\n",
    "are playing all the time in one way or another. Out burdens are\n",
    "here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and\n",
    "happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and\n",
    "mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City. Now, my\n",
    "little pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in\n",
    "19\n",
    "earnest, and see how far on you can get before Father comes\n",
    "home.’\n",
    "‘Really, Mother? Where are our bundles?’ asked Amy, who was a\n",
    "very literal young lady.\n",
    "‘Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I\n",
    "rather think she hasn’t got any,’ said her mother.\n",
    "‘Yes, I have. Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with\n",
    "nice pianos, and being afraid of people.’\n",
    "Beth’s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to\n",
    "laugh, but nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very\n",
    "much.\n",
    "‘Let us do it,’ said Meg thoughtfully. ‘It is only another name for\n",
    "trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do\n",
    "want to be good, it’s hard work and we forget, and don’t do our\n",
    "best.’\n",
    "‘We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came\n",
    "and pulled us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our\n",
    "roll of directions, like Christian. What shall we do about that?’\n",
    "asked Jo, delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to\n",
    "the very dull task of doing her duty.\n",
    "‘Look under your pillows christmas morning, and you will find\n",
    "your guidebook,’ replied Mrs. March.\n",
    "20\n",
    "They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the\n",
    "table, then out came the four little work baskets, and the\n",
    "needles flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was\n",
    "uninteresting sewing, but tonight no\n",
    "one grumbled. They adopted Jo’s plan of dividing the long\n",
    "seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia,\n",
    "Africa, and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially\n",
    "when they talked about the different countries as they stitched\n",
    "their way through them.\n",
    "At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went\n",
    "to bed. No one but Beth could get much music out of the old\n",
    "piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and\n",
    "making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they\n",
    "sang. Meg had a voice like a flute, and she and herr mother led\n",
    "the little choir. Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered\n",
    "through the airs at her own sweet will, always coming out at the\n",
    "wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most\n",
    "pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they\n",
    "could lisp...\n",
    "Crinkle, crinkle, ‘ittle ‘tar,\n",
    "and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a\n",
    "born singer. The first sound in the morning was her voice as she\n",
    "went about the house singing like a lark, and the last sound at\n",
    "21\n",
    "night was the same cheery sound, for the girls never grew too\n",
    "old for that familiar lullaby.\n",

    "Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning.\n",
    "No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt\n",
    "as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock\n",
    "fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she\n",
    "remembered her mother’s promise and, slipping her hand under\n",
    "her pillow, drew out a little crimson-covered book. She knew it\n",
    "very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever\n",
    "lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim\n",
    "going on a long journey. She woke Meg with a ‘Merry\n",
    "Christmas,’ and bade her see what was under her pillow. A\n",
    "green- covered book appeared, with the same picture inside,\n",
    "and a few words written by their mother, which made their one\n",
    "present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy\n",
    "woke to rummage and find their little books also, one dovecolored, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking about\n",
    "them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day.\n",
    "In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious\n",
    "nature, which unconsciously influenced her sisters,\n",
    "especially Jo, who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her\n",
    "because her advice was so gently given.\n",
    "23\n",
    "‘Girls,’ said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside\n",
    "her to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond,\n",
    "‘Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and\n",
    "we must begin at once. We used to be faithful about it, but\n",
    "since Father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us, we\n",
    "have neglected many things. You can do as you please, but I\n",
    "shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every\n",
    "morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and\n",
    "help me through the day.’\n",
    "Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her\n",
    "arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the\n",
    "quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.\n",
    "‘How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let’s do as they do. I’ll help you\n",
    "with the hard words, and they’’ explain things if we don’t\n",
    "understand,’ whispered Beth, very much impressed by the\n",
    "pretty books and her sisters, example.\n",
    "‘I’m glad mine is blue,’ said Amy. and then the rooms were very\n",
    "still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine\n",
    "crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a\n",
    "Christmas greeting.\n",
    "‘Where is Mother?’ asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank\n",
    "her for their gifts, half an hour later.\n",
    "24\n",
    "‘Goodness only knows. some poor creeter came a- beggin’, and\n",
    "your ma went straight off to see what was needed. There never\n",
    "was such a woman for givin’ away vittles and drink, clothes and\n",
    "firin’,’ replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg\n",
    "was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than\n",
    "a servant.\n",
    "‘She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have\n",
    "everything ready,’ said Meg, looking over the presents which\n",
    "were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be\n",
    "produced at the proper time. ‘why, where is Amy’s bottle of\n",
    "cologne?’ she added, as the little flask did not appear.\n",
    "‘She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a\n",
    "ribbon on it, or some such notion,’ replied Jo, dancing about the\n",
    "room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.\n",
    "‘How nice my handkerchiefs look, don’t they? Hannah washed\n",
    "and ironed them for me, and I marked them all myself,’ said\n",
    "Beth, looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had\n",
    "cost her such labor.\n",
    "‘Bless the child! She’s gone and put ‘Mother’ on them instead of\n",
    "‘M. March’. How funny!’ cried Jo, taking one up.\n",
    "25\n",
    "‘Isn’t that right? I thought it was better to do it so, because\n",
    "Meg’s initials are M.M., and I don’t want anyone to use these\n",
    "but Marmee,’ said Beth;, looking troubled.\n",
    "‘It’s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for\n",
    "no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I\n",
    "know,’ said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\n",
    "‘There’s Mother. Hide the basket, quick!’ cried Jo, as a door\n",
    "slammed and steps sounded in the hall.\n",
    "Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw\n",
    "her sisters all waiting for her.\n",
    "‘Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?’\n",
    "asked Meg, surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy\n",
    "Amy had been out so early.\n",
    "‘Don’t laugh at me, Jo! I didn’t mean anyone should know till\n",
    "the time came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big\n",
    "one, and I gave all my money to get it, and I’m truly trying not\n",
    "to be selfish any more.’\n",
    "As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced\n",
    "the cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little\n",
    "effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on\n",
    "26\n",
    "the spot, and Jo pronounced her ‘a trump’, while Beth ran to the\n",
    "window, and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately\n",
    "bottle.\n",
    "‘You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking\n",
    "about being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and\n",
    "changed it the minute I was up, and I’m so glad, for mine is the\n",
    "handsomest now.’\n",
    "Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa,\n",
    "and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.\n",
    "‘Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our\n",
    "books. We read some, and mean to every day,’ they all cried in\n",
    "chorus. ‘Merry Christmas, little daughters! I’m glad you began at\n",
    "once, and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word\n",
    "before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman\n",
    "with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed\n",
    "to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to\n",
    "eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were\n",
    "suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your\n",
    "breakfast as a Christmas present?’\n",
    "They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour,\n",
    "and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed\n",
    "impetuously, ‘I’m so glad you came before we began!’\n",
    "27\n",
    "‘May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?’\n",
    "asked Beth eagerly.\n",
    "‘I shall take the cream and the muffings,’ added Amy, heroically\n",
    "giving up the article she most liked.\n",
    "Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread\n",
    "into one big plate.\n",
    "‘I thought you’d do it,’ said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied.\n",
    "‘You shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will\n",
    "have bread and milk for breakfast, and make it up at\n",
    "dinnertime.’\n",
    "They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it\n",
    "was early, and they went through back streets, so few people\n",
    "saw them, and no one laughed at the queer party.\n",
    "A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no\n",
    "fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a\n",
    "group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt,\n",
    "trying to keep warm.\n",
    "How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls\n",
    "went in.\n",
    "‘Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!’ said the poor\n",
    "woman, crying for joy.\n",
    "‘Funny angels in hoods and mittens,’ said Jo, and set them to\n",
    "laughing.\n",
    "28\n",
    "In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at\n",
    "work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and\n",
    "stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak.\n",
    "Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her\n",
    "with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as\n",
    "tenderly as if it had been her own. The girls meantime spread\n",
    "the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so\n",
    "many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to understand\n",
    "the funny broken English.\n",
    "‘Das ist gut!’ ‘Die Engel-kinder!’ cried the poor things as they ate\n",
    "and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The\n",
    "girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it\n",
    "very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a\n",
    "‘Sancho’ ever since she was born. That was a very happy\n",
    "breakfast, though they didn’t get any of it. And when they went\n",
    "away, leaving comfort behind, I think there were not in all the\n",
    "city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave\n",
    "away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread\n",
    "and milk on Christmas morning.\n",
    "‘That’s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,’\n",
    "said Meg, as they set out their presents while their\n",
    "mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\n",
    "29\n",
    "Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love\n",
    "done up in the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses,\n",
    "white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the\n",
    "middle, gave quite an elegant air to the table.\n",
    "‘She’s coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three\n",
    "cheers for Marmee!’ cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to\n",
    "conduct Mother to the seat of honor.\n",
    "Beth played her gayest march, amy threw open the door, and\n",
    "Meg enacted escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both\n",
    "surprised and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she\n",
    "examined her presents and read the little notes which\n",
    "accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new\n",
    "handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with\n",
    "Amy’s cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the\n",
    "nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit.\n",
    "There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining,\n",
    "in the simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals\n",
    "so pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward,\n",
    "and then all fell to work.\n",
    "The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that\n",
    "the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening\n",
    "festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theater, and\n",
    "not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private\n",
    "30\n",
    "performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity\n",
    "being the mother of invention, made whatever they needed.\n",
    "Very clever were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars,\n",
    "antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with\n",
    "silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin\n",
    "spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the\n",
    "same useful diamond shaped bits left inn sheets when the lids\n",
    "of preserve pots were cut out. The big chamber was the scene\n",
    "of many innocent revels.\n",
    "No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her\n",
    "heart’s content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of\n",
    "russet leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who\n",
    "knew an actor. These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet\n",
    "once used by an artist for some picture, were Jo’s chief\n",
    "treasures and appeared on all occasions. The smallness of the\n",
    "company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take\n",
    "several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit\n",
    "for the hard work they did in learning three or four different\n",
    "parts, whisking\n",
    "in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage\n",
    "besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless\n",
    "amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would\n",
    "have been idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.\n",
    "31\n",
    "On christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was\n",
    "the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz\n",
    "curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy. There was a\n",
    "good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle\n",
    "of lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was\n",
    "apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment. Presently\n",
    "a bell sounded, the curtains flew apart, and the OPERATIC\n",
    "TRAGEDY began.\n",
    "‘A gloomy wood,’ according to the one playbill, was represented\n",
    "by a few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in\n",
    "the distance. This cave was made with a clothes horse for a\n",
    "roof, bureaus for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast,\n",
    "with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it. The\n",
    "stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect,\n",
    "especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch\n",
    "took off the cover. A moment was allowed for the first thrill to\n",
    "subside, then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with a clanking sword\n",
    "at his\n",
    "side, a slouching hat, black beard, mysterious cloak, and the\n",
    "boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he struck his\n",
    "forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his hatred to\n",
    "Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to kill the\n",
    "one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo’s voice, with an\n",
    "32\n",
    "occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very\n",
    "impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused\n",
    "for breath. bowing with the air of one accustomed to public\n",
    "praise, he stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth\n",
    "with a commanding, ‘What ho, minion! I need thee!’\n",
    "Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a\n",
    "red and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak.\n",
    "Hugo demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one\n",
    "destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised\n",
    "both, and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the\n",
    "love philter.\n",
    "Hither, hither, from thy home, Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\n",
    "Born of roses, fed on dew,\n",
    "Charms and potions canst thou brew? Bring me here, with elfin\n",
    "speed,\n",
    "The fragrant philter which I need.\n",
    "Make it sweet and swift and strong, Spirit, answer now my song!\n",
    "A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\n",
    "appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings,\n",
    "33\n",
    "golden hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand,\n",
    "it sang...\n",
    "Hither I come, From my airy home,\n",
    "Afar in the silver moon. Take the magic spell, And use it well,\n",
    "Or its power will vanish soon!\n",
    "And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch’s feet, the spirit\n",
    "vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another\n",
    "apparition, not a lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp\n",
    "appeared and, having croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at\n",
    "Hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh. Having warbled\n",
    "his thanks and put the potions in his boots, Hugo departed, and\n",
    "Hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her\n",
    "friends in times past, she had cursed him, and intends to thwart\n",
    "his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain fell, and\n",
    "the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits\n",
    "of the play.\n",
    "A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose\n",
    "again, but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage\n",
    "carpentery had been got up, no one murmured at the delay. It\n",
    "34\n",
    "was truly superb. A tower rose to the ceiling, halfway up\n",
    "appeared a window with a lamp burning in it, and behind the\n",
    "white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver dress,\n",
    "waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed\n",
    "cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of\n",
    "course. Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in\n",
    "melting tones. Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue,\n",
    "consented to fly. Then came the grand effect of the play.\n",
    "Roderigo produced a rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up\n",
    "one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she crept from\n",
    "her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo’s shoulder, and was about\n",
    "to leap gracfully down when ‘Alas! Alas for Zara!’ she forgot her\n",
    "train. It caught in the window, the tower tottered, leaned\n",
    "forward, fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the\n",
    "ruins.\n",
    "A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from\n",
    "the wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, ‘I told you\n",
    "so! I told you so!’ With wonderful\n",
    "presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed in, dragged\n",
    "out his daughter, with a hasty aside...\n",
    "‘Don’t laugh! Act as if it was all right!’ and, ordering Roderigo\n",
    "up, banished him form the kingdom with wrath and scorn.\n",
    "Though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him,\n",
    "35\n",
    "Roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir. This\n",
    "dauntless example fired Zara. She also defied her sire, and he\n",
    "ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle. A\n",
    "stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away,\n",
    "looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the\n",
    "speech he ought to have made.\n",
    "Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having\n",
    "come to free the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming\n",
    "and hides, sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and\n",
    "bid the the timid little servant, ‘Bear them to the captives in\n",
    "their cells, and tell them I shall come anon.’ The servant takes\n",
    "Hugo aside to tell him something, and Hagar changes the cups\n",
    "for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando, the ‘minion’,\n",
    "carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds\n",
    "the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a\n",
    "long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal of\n",
    "clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar\n",
    "informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power\n",
    "and melody.\n",
    "This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have\n",
    "thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long\n",
    "red hair rather marred the effect of the villain’s death. He was\n",
    "called before the curtain, and with great propriety appeared,\n",
    "36\n",
    "leading Hagar, whose singing was considered more wonderful\n",
    "than all the rest of the performance put together.\n",
    "Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of\n",
    "stabbing himself because he has been told that Zara has\n",
    "deserted him. Just as the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is\n",
    "sung under his window, informing him that Zara is true but in\n",
    "danger, and he can save her if he will. A key is thrown in, which\n",
    "unlocks the door, and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his\n",
    "chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love.\n",
    "Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don\n",
    "Pedro. He wishes her to go into a convent, but she won’t hear of\n",
    "it, and after a touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo\n",
    "dashes in and demands her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because\n",
    "he is not rich. They shout and gesticulate tremendously but\n",
    "cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted\n",
    "Zara, when the timid\n",
    "servant enters with a letter and a bag from Hagar, who has\n",
    "mysteriously disappeared. The latter informs the party that she\n",
    "bequeths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to\n",
    "Don Pedro, if he doesn’t make them happy. The bag is opened,\n",
    "and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till\n",
    "it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely softens the stern\n",
    "sire. He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,\n",
    "37\n",
    "and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don\n",
    "Pedro’s blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\n",
    "Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected\n",
    "check, for the cot bed, on which the dress circle was built,\n",
    "suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience.\n",
    "Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to the rescue, and all were taken\n",
    "out unhurt, though many were speechless with laughter. the\n",
    "excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah appeared, with\n",
    "‘Mrs. March’s compliments, and would the ladies walk down to\n",
    "supper.’\n",
    "This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the\n",
    "table, they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It\n",
    "was like Marmee to get up a little treat for them, but anything\n",
    "so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of\n",
    "plenty. There was ice cream, actually two dishes of it, pink and\n",
    "white, and cake and fruit and\n",
    "distracting french bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four\n",
    "great bouquets of hot house flowers.\n",
    "It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the\n",
    "table and then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it\n",
    "immensely.\n",
    "‘Is it fairies?’ asked Amy. ‘Santa Claus,’ said Beth.\n",
    "38\n",
    "‘Mother did it.’ And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray\n",
    "beard and white eyebrows.\n",
    "‘Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,’ cried Jo, with\n",
    "a sudden inspiration.\n",
    "‘All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,’ replied Mrs.\n",
    "March.\n",
    "‘The Laurence boy’s grandfather! What in the world put such a\n",
    "thing into his head? We don’t know him!’ exclaimed Meg.\n",
    "‘Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He\n",
    "is an odd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my\n",
    "father years ago, and he sent me a polite note this afternoon,\n",
    "saying he hoped I would allow him to express his friendly\n",
    "feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in\n",
    "honor of the day. I could not refuse, and so you have a little\n",
    "feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk breakfast.’\n",
    "‘That boy; put it into his head, I know he did! He’s a capital\n",
    "fellow, and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he’d\n",
    "like to know us but he’s bashful, and Meg is so prim she won’t\n",
    "let me speak to him when we pass,’ said Jo, as the plates went\n",
    "round, and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs\n",
    "of satisfaction.\n",
    "39\n",
    "‘You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don’t\n",
    "you?’ asked one of the girls. ‘My mother knows old Mr. Laurence,\n",
    "but says he’s very proud and doesn’t like to mix with his\n",
    "neighbors. He keeps his grandson shut up, when he isn’t riding\n",
    "or walking with his tutor, and makes him study very hard. We\n",
    "invited him to our party, but he didn’t come. Mother says he’s\n",
    "very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.’\n",
    "‘Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked\n",
    "over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket,\n",
    "and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to\n",
    "know him some day, for he needs fun, I’m sure he does,’ said Jo\n",
    "decidedly.\n",
    "‘I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I’ve\n",
    "no objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity\n",
    "comes. He brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked\n",
    "him in, if I had been sure what was\n",
    "going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away,\n",
    "hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own.’\n",
    "‘It’s a mercy you didn’t , Mother!’ laughed Jo, looking at her\n",
    "boots. ‘But we’ll have another play sometime that he can see.\n",
    "Perhaps he’ll help act. Wouldn’t that be jolly?’\n",
    "40\n",
    "‘I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!’ And\n",
    "Meg examined her flowers with great interest.\n",
    "‘They are lovely. But Beth’s roses are sweeter to me,’ said Mrs.\n",
    "March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.\n",
    "Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, ‘I wish I could\n",
    "send my bunch to Father. I’m afraid he isn’t having such a\n",
    "merry Christmas as we are.’\n",

    "here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice\n",

    "willing we should go, now what shall we wear?’\n",
    "‘What’s the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our\n",
    "poplins, because we haven’t got anything else?’ answered Jo\n",
    "with her mouth full.\n",
    "42\n",
    "‘If I only had a silk!’ sighed Meg. ‘Mother says I may when I’m\n",
    "eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.’\n",
    "‘I’m sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.\n",
    "Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in\n",
    "mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can’t\n",
    "take any out.’\n",
    "‘You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight.\n",
    "The front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and\n",
    "Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are\n",
    "lovely, and my gloves will do, though they aren’t as nice as I’d\n",
    "like.’\n",
    "‘Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can’t get any new ones,\n",
    "so I shall have to go without,’ said Jo, who never troubled\n",
    "herself much about dress.\n",
    "‘You must have gloves, or I won’t go,’ cried Meg decidedly.\n",
    "‘Gloves are more important than anything else. You can’t dance\n",
    "without them, and if you don’t I should be so mortified.’ ‘Then\n",
    "I’ll stay still. I don’t care much for company dancing. It’s no fun\n",
    "to go sailing round. I like to fly about and cut capers.’\n",
    "‘You can’t ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and\n",
    "you are so careless. She said when you spoiled the others that\n",
    "43\n",
    "she shouldn’t get you any more this winter. Can’t you make\n",
    "them do?’\n",
    "‘I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know\n",
    "how stained they are. That’s all I can do. No! I’ll tell you how we\n",
    "can manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one.\n",
    "Don’t you see?’\n",
    "‘Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove\n",
    "dreadfully,’ began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with\n",
    "her.\n",
    "‘Then I’ll go without. I don’t care what people say!’ cried Jo,\n",
    "taking up her book.\n",
    "‘You may have it, you may! Only don’t stain it, and do behave\n",
    "nicely. Don’t put your hands behind you, or stare, or say\n",
    "‘Christopher Columbus!’ will you?’\n",
    "‘Don’t worry about me. I’ll be as prim ad I can and not get into\n",
    "any scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and\n",
    "let me finish this splendid story.’\n",
    "So Meg went away to ‘accept with thanks’, look over her dress,\n",

    "On New Year’s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger\n",

    "the all-important business of ‘getting ready for the party’.\n",
    "Simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up\n",
    "and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell\n",
    "of burned hair pervaded the house. Meg wanted a few curls\n",
    "about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks\n",
    "with a pair of hot tongs.\n",
    "‘Ought they to smoke like that?’ asked Beth from her perch on\n",
    "the bed.\n",
    "‘It’s the dampness drying,’ replied Jo.\n",
    "‘What a queer smell! It’s like burned feathers,’ observed Amy,\n",
    "smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.\n",
    "‘There, now I’ll take off the papers and you’ll see a cloud of little\n",
    "ringlets,’ said Jo, putting down the tongs.\n",
    "She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared,\n",
    "for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser\n",
    "laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her\n",
    "victim.\n",
    "‘Oh, oh, oh! What have you done? I’m spoiled! I can’t go! My\n",
    "hair, oh, my hair!’ wailed Meg, looking with despair at the\n",
    "uneven frizzle on her forehead.\n",
    "45\n",
    "‘Just my luck! You shouldn’t have asked me to do it. I always\n",
    "spoil everything. I’m so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and\n",
    "so I’ve made a mess,’ groaned poor Jo, regarding the little\n",
    "black pancakes with tears of regret.\n",
    "‘It isn’t spoiled. Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends\n",
    "come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last\n",
    "fashion. I’ve seen many girls do it so,’ said Amy consolingly.\n",
    "‘Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I’d let my hair\n",
    "alone,’ cried Meg petulantly.\n",
    "‘So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out\n",
    "again,’ said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\n",
    "After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by\n",
    "the united exertions of the entire family Jo’s hair was got up\n",
    "and her dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits,\n",
    "Meg’s in silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and\n",
    "the pearl pin. Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar,\n",
    "and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each\n",
    "put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all\n",
    "pronounced the effect ‘quite easy and fine\". Meg’s high-heeled\n",
    "slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own\n",
    "it, and Jo’s nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into\n",
    "46\n",
    "her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let\n",
    "us be elegant or die.\n",
    "‘Have a good time, dearies!’ said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\n",
    "daintily down the walk. ‘Don’t eat much supper, and come away\n",
    "at eleven when I send Hannah for you.’ As the gate clashed\n",
    "behind them, a voice cried from a window...\n",
    "‘Girls, girls! Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?’\n",
    "‘Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,’ cried Jo,\n",
    "adding with a laugh as they went on, ‘I do believe Marmee\n",
    "would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake.\n",
    "‘It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real\n",
    "lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,’\n",
    "replied Meg, who had a good many little ‘aristocratic tastes’ of\n",
    "her own.\n",
    "‘Now don’t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is\n",
    "my sash right? And does my hair look very bad?’ said Meg, as\n",
    "she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner’s dressing room after\n",
    "a prolonged prink.\n",
    "‘I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just\n",
    "remind me by a wink, will you?’ returned Jo, giving her collar a\n",
    "twitch and her head a hasty brush.\n",
    "47\n",
    "‘No, winking isn’t ladylike. I’ll lift my eyebrows if any thing is\n",
    "wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulder\n",
    "straight, and take short steps, and don’t shake hands if you are\n",
    "introduced to anyone. It isn’t the thing.’\n",
    "‘How do you learn all the proper ways? I never can.\n",
    "Isn’t that music gay?’\n",
    "Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to\n",
    "parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event\n",
    "to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly\n",
    "and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg\n",
    "knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn’t\n",
    "care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back\n",
    "carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a\n",
    "colt in a flower garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking\n",
    "about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go\n",
    "and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life. She\n",
    "telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so\n",
    "alarmingly that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her,\n",
    "and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone.\n",
    "She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned\n",
    "breadth would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till\n",
    "the dancing began. Meg was\n",
    "48\n",
    "asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly\n",
    "that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered\n",
    "smilingly. Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her\n",
    "corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a\n",
    "curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace.\n",
    "Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the same\n",
    "refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face\n",
    "to face with the ‘Laurence boy’.\n",
    "‘Dear me, I didn’t know anyone was here!’ stammered Jo,\n",
    "preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.\n",
    "But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a\n",
    "little startled, ‘Don’t mind me, stay if you like.’\n",
    "‘Shan’t I disturb you?’\n",
    "‘Not a bit. I only came here because I don’t know many people\n",
    "and felt rather strange at first, you know.’\n",
    "‘So did I. Don’t go away, please, unless you’d rather.’\n",
    "The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said,\n",
    "trying to be polite and easy, ‘I think I’ve had the pleasure of\n",
    "seeing you before. You live near us, don’t you?’\n",
    "‘Next door.’ And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo’s\n",
    "prim manner was rather funny when he\n",
    "49\n",
    "remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he\n",
    "brought the cat home.\n",
    "That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her\n",
    "heartiest way, ‘We did have such a good time over your nice\n",
    "Christmas present.’\n",
    "‘Grandpa sent it.’\n",
    "‘But you put it into his head, didn’t you, now?’\n",
    "‘How is your cat, Miss March?’ asked the boy, trying to look\n",
    "sober while his black eyes shone with fun.\n",
    "‘Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I am not Miss March, I’m\n",
    "only Jo,’ returned the young lady.\n",
    "‘I’m not Mr. Laurence, I’m only Laurie.’ ‘Laurie Laurence, what\n",
    "an odd name.’\n",
    "‘My first name is theodore, but I don’t like it, for the fellows\n",
    "called me Dora, so I made the say Laurie instead.’\n",
    "‘I hate my name, too, so sentimental! I wish every one would\n",
    "say Jo instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop\n",
    "calling you Dora?’\n",
    "‘I thrashed ‘em.’\n",
    "‘I can’t thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.’\n",
    "And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.\n",
    "‘Don’t you like to dance, Miss Jo?’ asked Laurie, looking as if he\n",
    "thought the name suited her.\n",
    "50\n",
    "‘I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is\n",
    "lively. In a place like this I’m sure to upset something, tread on\n",
    "people’s toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of\n",
    "mischief and let Meg sail about. Don’t you dance?’\n",
    "‘Sometimes. You see I’ve been abroad a good many years, and\n",
    "haven’t been into company enough yet to know how you do\n",
    "things here.’\n",
    "‘Abroad!.’ cried Jo. ‘Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear\n",
    "people describe their travels.’\n",
    "Laurie didn’t seem to know where to begin, but Jo’s eager\n",
    "questions soon set him going, and he told her how he had been\n",
    "at school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a\n",
    "fleet of boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking\n",
    "trips about Switzerland with their teachers.\n",
    "‘Don’t I wish I’d been there!’ cried Jo. ‘Did you go to Paris?’\n",
    "‘We spent last winter there.’ ‘Can you talk French?’\n",
    "‘We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.’ ‘Do say\n",
    "some! I can read it, but can’t pronounce.’ ‘Quel nom a cetter\n",
    "jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles\n",
    "jolis?’\n",
    "51\n",
    "‘How nicely you do it! Let me see...you said, ‘Who is the young\n",
    "lady in the pretty slippers’, didn’t you?’\n",
    "‘Oui, mademoiselle.’\n",
    "‘It’s my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she\n",
    "is pretty?’\n",
    "‘Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh\n",
    "and quiet, and dances like a lady.’\n",
    "Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister,\n",
    "and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and critisized\n",
    "and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie’s\n",
    "bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo’s gentlemanly demeanor\n",
    "amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self\n",
    "again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their\n",
    "eyebrows at her. She liked the ‘Laurence boy’ better than ever\n",
    "and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe\n",
    "him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins,\n",
    "and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.\n",
    "‘Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose,\n",
    "fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for\n",
    "a boy, and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?’\n",
    "52\n",
    "It was on the tip of Jo’s tongue to ask, but she checked herself\n",
    "in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about\n",
    "way.\n",
    "‘I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging\n",
    "away at your books, no, I mean studying hard.’ And Jo blushed\n",
    "at the dreadful ‘pegging’ which had escaped her.\n",
    "Laurie smiled but didn’t seem shocked, and answered with a\n",
    "shrug. ‘Not for a year or two. I won’t go before seventeen,\n",
    "anyway.’\n",
    "‘Aren’t you but fifteen?’ asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom\n",
    "she had imagined seventeen already.\n",
    "‘Sixteen, next month.’\n",
    "‘How I wish I was going to college! You don’t look as if you liked\n",
    "it.’\n",
    "‘I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don’t like the\n",
    "way fellows do either, in this country.’ ‘What do you like?’\n",
    "‘To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.’\n",
    "Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his\n",
    "black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she\n",
    "changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, ‘That’s a\n",
    "splendid polka! Why don’t you go and try it?’\n",
    "53\n",
    "‘If you will come too,’ he answered, with a gallant little bow.\n",
    "‘I can’t, for I told meg I wouldn’t, because...’ There Jo stopped,\n",
    "and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\n",
    "‘Because, what?’ ‘You won’t tell?’ ‘Never!’\n",
    "‘Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I\n",
    "burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it’s nicely\n",
    "mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would\n",
    "see it. You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know.’\n",
    "But Laurie didn’t laugh. He only looked dawn a minute, and the\n",
    "expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently,\n",
    "‘Never mind that. I’ll tell you how we can manage. There’s a long\n",
    "hall out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us.\n",
    "Please come.’\n",
    "Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat\n",
    "gloves when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner\n",
    "wore. The hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for\n",
    "Laurie danced well, and taught her the German step, which\n",
    "delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring. When the music\n",
    "stopped, they sat down on the stairs to\n",
    "get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a\n",
    "students’ festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search\n",
    "of her sister. She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into\n",
    "54\n",
    "a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot,\n",
    "and looking pale.\n",
    "‘I’ve sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave\n",
    "me a sad wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don’t\n",
    "know how I’m ever going to get home,’ she said, rocking to and\n",
    "fro in pain.\n",
    "‘I knew you’d hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I’m sorry. But\n",
    "I don’t see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here\n",
    "all night,’ answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she\n",
    "spoke.\n",
    "‘I can’t have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I dare\n",
    "say I can’t get one at all, for most people come in their own,\n",
    "and it’s a long way to the stable, and no one to send.’ ‘I’ll go.’\n",
    "‘No, indeed! It’s past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can’t stop here,\n",
    "for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I’ll\n",
    "rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.’\n",
    "‘I’ll ask Laurie. He will go,’ said Jo,’ looking relieved as the idea\n",
    "occurred to her.\n",
    "‘Mercy, no! Don’t ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers, and put\n",
    "these slippers with our things. I can’t dance anymore, but as\n",
    "soon as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the\n",
    "minute she comes.’\n",
    "55\n",
    "‘They are going out to supper now. I’ll stay with you.\n",
    "I’d rather.’\n",
    "‘No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I’m so tired I\n",
    "can’t stir.’\n",
    "So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went\n",
    "blundering away to the dining room, which she found after\n",
    "going into a china closet, and opening the door of a room\n",
    "where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment.\n",
    "Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee, which she\n",
    "immediately spilled, thereby making the front of her dress as\n",
    "bad as the back.\n",
    "‘Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!’ exclaimed Jo, finishing\n",
    "Meg’s glove by scrubbing her gown with it.\n",
    "‘Can I help you?’ said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie,\n",
    "with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\n",
    "‘I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and\n",
    "someone shook me, and here I am in a nice state,’ answered\n",
    "Jo, glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffeecolored glove.\n",
    "‘Too bad! I was looking for someone to give this to.\n",
    "May I take it to your sister?’\n",
    "56\n",
    "‘Oh, thank you! I’ll show you where she is. I don’t offer to take it\n",
    "myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.’\n",
    "Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew\n",
    "up a little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice\n",
    "for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg\n",
    "pronounced him a ‘nice boy’. They had a merry time over the\n",
    "bonbons and mottoes, and were in the midst of a quiet game of\n",
    "BUZZ, with two or three other young people who had strayed in,\n",
    "when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot and rose so\n",
    "quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an\n",
    "exclamation of pain.\n",
    "‘Hush! Don’t say anything,’ she whispered, adding aloud, ‘It’s\n",
    "nothing. I turned my foot a little, that’s all,’ and limped upstairs\n",
    "to put her things on. Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at\n",
    "her wits’ end, till se decided to take things into her own hands.\n",
    "Slipping out, she ran down and, finding a servant, asked if he\n",
    "could get her a carriage. It happened to be a hired waiter who\n",
    "knew nothing about the neighborhood and Jo was looking\n",
    "round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she said,\n",
    "came up and offered his grandfather’s carriage, which had just\n",
    "come for him, he said.\n",
    "‘It’s so early! You can’t mean to go yet?’ began Jo. looking\n",
    "relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.\n",
    "57\n",
    "‘I always go early, I do, truly! Please let me take you home. It’s\n",
    "all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.’\n",
    "That settled it, and telling him of Meg’s mishap, Jo gratefully\n",
    "accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.\n",
    "Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no\n",
    "trouble, and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage,\n",
    "feeling very festive and elegant. Laurie went on the box so Meg\n",
    "could keep her foot up, and the girls talked over their party in\n",
    "freedom.\n",
    "‘I had a capital time. Did you?’ asked Jo, rumpling up her hair,\n",
    "and making herself comfortable.\n",
    "‘Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie’s friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy\n",
    "to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when\n",
    "Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes,\n",
    "and it will be perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,’\n",
    "answered Meg, cheering up at the thought.\n",
    "‘I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from.\n",
    "Was he nice?’\n",
    "‘Oh. very! His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and\n",
    "I had a delicious redowa with him.’\n",
    "‘He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step.\n",
    "Laurie and I couldn’t help laughing. Did you hear us?’\n",
    "58\n",
    "‘No, but it was very rude. What were you about all that time,\n",
    "hidden away there?’\n",
    "Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they\n",
    "were at home. With many thanks, they said good night and\n",
    "crept in, hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door\n",
    "creaked, two little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but\n",
    "eager voices cried out...\n",
    "‘Tell about the party! Tell about the party!’\n",
    "With what Meg called ‘a great want of manners’ Jo had saved\n",
    "some bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after\n",
    "hearing the most thrilling events of the evening.\n",
    "‘I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come\n",
    "home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown\n",
    "wit a maid to wait on me,’ said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot\n",
    "with arnica and brushed her hair.\n",
    "‘I don’t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more\n",
    "than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove\n",
    "apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles\n",
    "when we are silly enough to wear them,’ And I think Jo was\n",
    "quite right.\n",
    "59\n",
    "C H A P T E R IV\n",
    "‘Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go\n",
    "on,’ sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the\n",
    "holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for\n",
    "going on easily with the task she never liked.\n",
    "‘I wish it was Christmas or New Year’s all the time.\n",
    "Wouldn’t it be fun?’ answered Jo, yawning dismally.\n",
    "‘We shouldn’t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it\n",
    "does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go\n",
    "to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It’s\n",
    "like other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do\n",
    "such things, I’m so fond of luxury,’ said Meg, trying to decide\n",
    "which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby.\n",
    "‘Well, we can’t have it, so don’t let us grumble but shoulder our\n",
    "bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I’m\n",
    "sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I\n",
    "suppose when I’ve learned to carry her without complaining,\n",
    "she will tumble off, or get so light that I shan’t mind her.’\n",
    "This idea tickled Jo’s fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg\n",
    "didn’t brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled\n",
    "children, seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough\n",
    "60\n",
    "even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck\n",
    "ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.\n",
    "‘Where’s the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those\n",
    "cross midgets, and no one cares whether I’m pretty or not?’ she\n",
    "muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. ‘I shall have to toil\n",
    "and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then,\n",
    "and get old and ugly and sour, because I’m poor and can’t\n",
    "enjoy my life as other girls do. It’s a shame!’\n",
    "So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn’t at all\n",
    "agreeable at breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather out of\n",
    "sorts and inclined to croak.\n",
    "Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort\n",
    "herself with the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because\n",
    "her lessons were not learned, and she couldn’t find her rubbers.\n",
    "Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready.\n",
    "Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go\n",
    "at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn’t\n",
    "suit her.\n",
    "‘There never was such a cross family!’ cried Jo, losing her\n",
    "temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot\n",
    "lacings, and sat down upon her hat.\n",
    "61\n",
    "‘You’re the crossest person in it!’ returned Amy, washing out the\n",
    "sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her\n",
    "slate.\n",
    "‘Beth, if you don’t keep these horrid cats down cellar I’ll have\n",
    "them drowned,’ exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of\n",
    "the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a\n",
    "burr just out of reach.\n",
    "Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed\n",
    "because she couldn’t remember how much nine times twelve\n",
    "was.\n",
    "‘Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off by the\n",
    "early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,’ cried\n",
    "Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.\n",
    "There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in,\n",
    "laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These\n",
    "turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them ‘muffs’,\n",
    "for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting\n",
    "to their hands on cold mornings.\n",
    "Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or\n",
    "grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor\n",
    "things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two.\n",
    "62\n",
    "‘Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye,\n",
    "Marmee. We are a set of rascals this morning, but we’ll come\n",
    "home regular angels. Now then, Meg!’ And Jo tramped away,\n",
    "feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to\n",
    "do.\n",
    "They always looked back before turning the corner, for their\n",
    "mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and wave\n",
    "her hand to them. Somehow it seemed as if they couldn’t have\n",
    "got through the day without that, for whatever their mood\n",
    "might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to\n",
    "affect them like sunshine.\n",
    "‘If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it\n",
    "would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are\n",
    "were never seen,’ cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in\n",
    "the snowy walk and bitter wind. ‘Don’t use such dreadful\n",
    "expressions,’ replied Meg from the depths of the veil in which\n",
    "she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.\n",
    "‘I like good strong words that mean something,’ replied Jo,\n",
    "catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to\n",
    "flying away altogether.\n",
    "‘Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a\n",
    "wretch and I don’t choose to be called so.’\n",
    "63\n",
    "‘You’re a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because\n",
    "you can’t sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait\n",
    "till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice\n",
    "cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed\n",
    "boys to dance with.’\n",
    "‘How ridiculous you are, Jo!’ But Meg laughed at the nonsense\n",
    "and felt better in spite of herself.\n",
    "‘Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be\n",
    "dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness,\n",
    "I can always find something funny to keep me up. Don’t croak\n",
    "any more, but come home jolly, there’s a dear.’\n",
    "Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they\n",
    "parted for the day, each going a different way, each hugging\n",
    "her little warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite\n",
    "of wintry weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of\n",
    "pleasure-loving youth.\n",
    "When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an\n",
    "unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be\n",
    "allowed to do something toward their own support, at least.\n",
    "Believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy,\n",
    "industry, and independence, their parents consented, and both\n",
    "64\n",
    "fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all\n",
    "obstacles is sure to succeed at last.\n",
    "Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with\n",
    "her small salary. As she said, she was ‘fond of luxury’, and her\n",
    "chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the\n",
    "others because she could remember a time when home was\n",
    "beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind\n",
    "unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it was\n",
    "very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things,\n",
    "gay friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings’\n",
    "she daily saw all she wanted, for the children’s older sisters were\n",
    "just out, and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball\n",
    "dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about theaters,\n",
    "concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds, and\n",
    "saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so\n",
    "precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of\n",
    "injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for\n",
    "she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the\n",
    "blessings which alone can make life happy.\n",
    "Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an\n",
    "active person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had\n",
    "offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and\n",
    "was much offended because her offer was declined. Other\n",
    "65\n",
    "friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being\n",
    "remembered in the rich old lady’s will, but the unworldly\n",
    "Marches only said...\n",
    "‘We can’t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we\n",
    "will keep together and be happy in one another.’\n",
    "The old lady wouldn’t speak to them for a time, but happening\n",
    "to meet Jo at at a friend’s, something in her comical face and\n",
    "blunt manners struck the old lady’s fancy, and she proposed to\n",
    "take her for a companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she\n",
    "accepted the place since nothing better appeared and, to every\n",
    "one’s surprise, got on remarkably well with her irascible relative.\n",
    "There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home,\n",
    "declaring she couldn’t bear it longer, but Aunt March always\n",
    "cleared up quickly, and sent for her to come back again with\n",
    "such urgency that she could not refuse, for in her heart she\n",
    "rather liked the peppery old lady.\n",
    "I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine\n",
    "books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle\n",
    "March died. Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used\n",
    "to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries,\n",
    "tell her stories about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy\n",
    "her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. The\n",
    "dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the tall\n",
    "66\n",
    "bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of all, the\n",
    "wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked,\n",
    "made the library a region of bliss to her.\n",
    "The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with\n",
    "company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in\n",
    "the easy chair, devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and\n",
    "pictures like a regular bookworm. But, like all happiness, it did\n",
    "not last long, for as sure as she had just reached the heart of\n",
    "the story, the sweetest verse of a song, or the most perilous\n",
    "adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice called, ‘Josy-phine! Josyphine! and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the\n",
    "poodle, or read Belsham’s Essays by the hour together.\n",
    "Jo’s ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was,\n",
    "she had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and\n",
    "meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she\n",
    "couldn’t read, run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick\n",
    "temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit\n",
    "were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series\n",
    "of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the\n",
    "training she received at Aunt March’s was just what she needed,\n",
    "and the thought that she was doing something to support\n",
    "herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual ‘Josy-phine!’\n",
    "67\n",
    "Beth was too bashful to go to school.It had been tried, but she\n",
    "suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons\n",
    "at home with her father. Even when he went away, and her\n",
    "mother was called to devote her skill and energy to Soldiers’ Aid\n",
    "Societies, Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she\n",
    "could. She was a housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah\n",
    "keep home neat and comfortable for the workers, never\n",
    "thinking of any reward but to be loved. Long, quiet days she\n",
    "spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little world was peopled with\n",
    "imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy bee. There\n",
    "were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for\n",
    "Beth was a child still and and loved her pets as well as ever. Not\n",
    "one whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till\n",
    "Beth took them in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they\n",
    "passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly.\n",
    "Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason,\n",
    "and set up a\n",
    "hospital for infirm dolls. No pins were ever stuck into their\n",
    "cotton vitals, no harsh words or blows were ever given them, no\n",
    "neglect ever saddened the heart or the most repulsive, but all\n",
    "were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed with an affection\n",
    "which never failed. One forlorn fragment of dollanity had\n",
    "belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a\n",
    "wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was\n",
    "68\n",
    "rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge. Having no top to its\n",
    "head, she tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs\n",
    "were gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket\n",
    "and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid. If anyone had\n",
    "known the care lavished on that dolly, I think it would have\n",
    "touched their hearts, even while they laughed. She brought it\n",
    "bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out to breathe fresh air,\n",
    "hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and never went to\n",
    "be without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly, ‘I hope\n",
    "you’ll have a good night, my poor dear.’\n",
    "Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an\n",
    "angel but a very human little girl, she often ‘wept a little weep’\n",
    "as Jo said, because she couldn’t take music lessons and have a\n",
    "fine piano. She loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and\n",
    "practiced away so patiently at\n",
    "the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if someone (not\n",
    "to hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however,\n",
    "and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that\n",
    "wouldn’t keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a\n",
    "little lark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee and\n",
    "the girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself,’ I know I’ll\n",
    "get my music some time, if I’m good.’\n",
    "69\n",
    "There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in\n",
    "corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no\n",
    "one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops\n",
    "chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving\n",
    "silence and shadow behind.\n",
    "If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life\n",
    "was, she would have answered at once, ‘My nose.’ When she\n",
    "was a baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod,\n",
    "and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It\n",
    "was not big nor red, like poor ‘Petrea’s’, it was only rather flat,\n",
    "and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic\n",
    "point. No one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to\n",
    "grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose, and drew\n",
    "whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.\n",
    "‘Little Raphael,’ as her sisters called her, had a decided talent\n",
    "for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers,\n",
    "designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of\n",
    "art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she\n",
    "covered her slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas\n",
    "were used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most\n",
    "ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at\n",
    "unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as well as she\n",
    "could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of\n",
    "70\n",
    "deportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being\n",
    "good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing\n",
    "without effort. Her little airs and graces were much admired, so\n",
    "were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could\n",
    "play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without\n",
    "mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words. She had a\n",
    "plaintive way of saying, ‘When Papa was rich we did so-and-so,’\n",
    "which was very touching, and her long words were considered\n",
    "‘perfectly elegant’ by the girls.\n",
    "Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her,\n",
    "and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely.\n",
    "One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities. She had to\n",
    "wear her cousin’s clothes. Now\n",
    "Florence’s mama hadn’t a particle of taste, and Amy suffered\n",
    "deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,\n",
    "unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit.\n",
    "Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy’s\n",
    "artistic eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when\n",
    "her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no\n",
    "trimming.\n",
    "‘My only comfort,’ she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, ‘is\n",
    "that Mother doesn’t take tucks in my dresses whenever I’m\n",
    "naughty, as Maria Parks’s mother does. My dear, it’s really\n",
    "71\n",
    "dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her\n",
    "knees, and she can’t come to school. When I think of this\n",
    "deggerredation, I fell that I can bear even my flat nose and\n",
    "purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it.’\n",
    "Meg was Amy’s confidante and monitor, and by some strange\n",
    "attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth’s. To Jo alone did\n",
    "the shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum\n",
    "sister Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone\n",
    "in the family. The two older girls were a great deal to one\n",
    "another, but each took one of the younger sisters into her\n",
    "keeping and watched over her in her own way, ‘playing mother’\n",
    "they called it, and put their\n",
    "sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct\n",
    "of litte women.\n",
    "‘Has anybody got anything to tell? It’s been such a dismal day\n",
    "I’m really dying for some amusement,’ said Meg, as they sat\n",
    "sewing together that evening.\n",
    "‘I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it,\n",
    "I’ll tell you about it,’ began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. ‘I\n",
    "was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I\n",
    "always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some\n",
    "nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I actually made\n",
    "myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a gape\n",
    "72\n",
    "that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide\n",
    "enough to take the whole book in at once.\n",
    "‘I wish I could, and be done with it,’ said I, trying not to be\n",
    "saucy.\n",
    "‘Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit\n",
    "and think them over while she just ‘lost’ herself for a moment.\n",
    "She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began\n",
    "to bob like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the VICAR OF\n",
    "WAKEFIELD out of my pocket, and read away, with one eye on\n",
    "him and one on Aunt. I’d just got to where they all tumbled into\n",
    "the water when I forgot and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up\n",
    "and,\n",
    "being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit\n",
    "and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and\n",
    "instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\n",
    "she only said...\n",
    "‘I don’t understand what it’s all about. Go back and begin it,\n",
    "child.’\n",
    "‘Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I\n",
    "could. Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and\n",
    "say meekly, ‘I’m afraid it tires you, ma’am. Shan’t I stop now?’\n",
    "73\n",
    "‘She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her\n",
    "hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her\n",
    "short way, ‘Finish the chapter, and don’t be impertinent, miss’.’\n",
    "‘Did she own she liked it?’ asked Meg.\n",
    "‘Oh, bless you, no! But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran\n",
    "back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at\n",
    "the Vicar that she didn’t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the\n",
    "hall because of the good time coming. What a pleasant life she\n",
    "might have if only she chose! I don’t envy her much, in spite of\n",
    "her money, for after all rich people have about as many worries\n",
    "as poor ones, I think,’ added Jo.\n",
    "‘That reminds me,’ said Meg, ‘that I’ve got something to tell. It\n",
    "isn’t funny, like Jo’s story, but I thought about it a good deal as\n",
    "I came home. At the Kings’ today I found everybody in a flurry,\n",
    "and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done\n",
    "something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs.\n",
    "King crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen\n",
    "turned away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn’t\n",
    "see how red and swollen their eyes were. I didn’t ask any\n",
    "questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and was rather\n",
    "glad I hadn’t any wild brothers to do wicked things and\n",
    "disgrace the family.’\n",
    "74\n",
    "‘I think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than\n",
    "anything bad boys can do,’ said Amy, shaking her head, as if\n",
    "her experience of life had been a deep one. ‘Susie Perkins came\n",
    "to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it\n",
    "dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might. Well, she\n",
    "drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump,\n",
    "and the words, ‘Young ladies, my eye is upon you!’ coming out\n",
    "of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were laughing over it when\n",
    "all of a sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring\n",
    "up her slate. She was parrylized with fright, but she went, and\n",
    "oh, what do you think he did? He took her by\n",
    "the ear—the ear! Just fancy how horrid!—and led her to the\n",
    "recitation platform, and made her stand there half and hour,\n",
    "holding the slate so everyone could see.’\n",
    "‘Didn’t the girls laugh at the picture?’ asked Jo, who relished the\n",
    "scrape.\n",
    "‘Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I\n",
    "know she did. I didn’t envy her then, for I felt that millions of\n",
    "carnelian rings wouldn’t have made me happy after that. I\n",
    "never, never should have got over such a agonizing\n",
    "mortification.’ And Amy went on with her work, in the proud\n",
    "consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two\n",
    "long words in a breath.\n",
    "75\n",
    "‘I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at\n",
    "dinner, but I forgot,’ said Beth, putting Jo’s topsy- turvy basket\n",
    "in order as she talked. ‘When I went to get some oysters for\n",
    "Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn’t see me,\n",
    "for I kept behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr.\n",
    "Cutter the fishman. A poor woman came in with a pail a mop,\n",
    "and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a\n",
    "bit of fish, because she hadn&#x2019;t any dinner for her\n",
    "children, and had been disappointed of a day’s work. Mr. Cutter\n",
    "was in a hurry and said ‘No’, rather crossly, so she was going\n",
    "away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr.\n",
    "Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane\n",
    "and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised she took it\n",
    "right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. He told her\n",
    "to ‘go along and cook it’, and she hurried off, so happy! Wasn’t\n",
    "it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,\n",
    "slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence’s bed in heaven would be\n",
    "‘aisy’.’\n",
    "When they had laughed at Beth’s story, they asked their mother\n",
    "for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, ‘As I\n",
    "sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt\n",
    "very anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless\n",
    "we should be , if anything happened to him. It was not a wise\n",
    "76\n",
    "thing to do, but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with\n",
    "an order for some clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to\n",
    "talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and anxious.\n",
    "‘‘Have you sons in the army?’ I asked, for the note he brought\n",
    "was not to me. ‘Yes, ma’am. I had four, but two were killed, one\n",
    "is a prisoner, and I’m going to the other, who is very sick in a\n",
    "Washington hospital.’ he answered quietly.\n",
    "‘‘You have done a great deal for your country, sir, ‘ I said,\n",
    "feeling respect now, instead of pity.\n",
    "‘‘Not a mite more than I ought, ma’am. I’d go myself, if I was\n",
    "any use. As I ain’t, I give my boys, and give ‘em free.’\n",
    "‘He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad\n",
    "to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I’d given one man\n",
    "and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging\n",
    "them. I had all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son\n",
    "was waiting, miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps! I felt\n",
    "so rich, so happy thinking of my blessings, that I made him a\n",
    "nice bundle, gave him some money, and thanked him heartily\n",
    "for the lesson he had taught me.’\n",
    "‘Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like\n",
    "to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too\n",
    "preachy,’ said Jo, after a minute’s silence.\n",
    "77\n",
    "Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to\n",
    "this little audience for many years, and knew how to please\n",
    "them.\n",
    "‘Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat\n",
    "and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind\n",
    "friends and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were\n",
    "not contented.’ (Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another,\n",
    "and began to sew diligently.) ‘These girls were anxious to be\n",
    "good and made\n",
    "many excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very\n",
    "well, and were constantly saying, ‘If only we had this, ‘ or ‘If we\n",
    "could only do that, ‘ quite forgetting how much they already\n",
    "had, and how many things they actually could do. So they asked\n",
    "an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy,\n",
    "and she said, ‘When you feel discontented, think over your\n",
    "blessings, and be grateful.’’ (Here Jo looked up quickly, as if\n",
    "about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story\n",
    "was not done yet.)\n",
    "‘Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon\n",
    "were surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered\n",
    "that money couldn’t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people’s\n",
    "houses, another that, though she was poor, she was a great\n",
    "deal happier, with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a\n",
    "78\n",
    "certain fretful, feeble old lady who couldn’t enjoy her comforts,\n",
    "a third that, disagreeable as it was to help get dinner, it was\n",
    "harder still to go begging for it and the fourth, that even\n",
    "carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior. So they\n",
    "agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings already\n",
    "possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken\n",
    "away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were\n",
    "never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman’s\n",
    "advice.’\n",
    "‘Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own\n",
    "stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!’\n",
    "cried Meg. ‘I like that kind of sermon. It’s the sort Father used to\n",
    "tell us,’ said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on\n",
    "Jo’s cushion.\n",
    "‘I don’t complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be\n",
    "more careful than ever now, for I’ve had warning from Susies’s\n",
    "downfall,’ said Amy morally.\n",
    "‘We needed that lesson, and we won’t forget it. If we do so, you\n",
    "just say to us, as old Chloe did in UNCLE TOM, ‘Tink ob yer\n",
    "marcies, chillen! ‘Tink ob yer marcies!’’ added Jo, who could not,\n",
    "for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little\n",
    "sermon, though she took it to heart as much as any of them.\n",
    "79\n",
    "C H A P T E R V\n",
    "‘What in the world are you going to do now, Jo.’ asked Meg one\n",
    "snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall,\n",
    "in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand\n",
    "and a shovel in the other.\n",
    "‘Going out for exercise,’ answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle\n",
    "in her eyes.\n",
    "‘I should think two long walks this morning would have been\n",
    "enough! It’s cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm\n",
    "and dry by the fire, as I do,’ said Meg with a shiver.\n",
    "‘Never take advice! Can’t keep still all day, and not being a\n",
    "pussycat, I don’t like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and\n",
    "I’m going to find some.’\n",
    "Meg went back to toast her feet and read IVANHOE, and Jo\n",
    "began to dig paths with great energy. The snow was light, and\n",
    "with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for\n",
    "Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls\n",
    "needed air. Now, the garden separated the Marches’ house\n",
    "from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the city,\n",
    "which was still countrylike, with groves and lawns, large\n",
    "gardens, and\n",
    "80\n",
    "quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one side\n",
    "was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby,\n",
    "robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the\n",
    "flowers, which then surrounded it. On the other side was a\n",
    "stately stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort\n",
    "and luxury, from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to\n",
    "the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught\n",
    "between the rich curtains.\n",
    "Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children\n",
    "frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the\n",
    "windows, and few people went in and out, except the old\n",
    "gentleman and his grandson.\n",
    "To Jo’s lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted\n",
    "palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She\n",
    "had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know\n",
    "the Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if\n",
    "he only knew how to begin. Since the party, she had been more\n",
    "eager than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends\n",
    "with him, but he had not been seen lately, and Jo began to think\n",
    "he had gone away, when she one day spied a brown face at an\n",
    "upper window, looking wistfully down into their\n",
    "garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.\n",
    "81\n",
    "‘That boy is suffering for society and fun,’ she said to herself.\n",
    "‘His grandpa does not know what’s good for him, and keeps\n",
    "him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with,\n",
    "or somebody young and lively. I’ve a great mind to go over and\n",
    "tell the old gentleman so!’\n",
    "The idea amused Jo. who liked to do daring things and was\n",
    "always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan\n",
    "of ‘going over’ was not forgotten. And when the snowy\n",
    "afternoon came, Jo resolved to try what could be done. She\n",
    "saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then sallied out to dig her way\n",
    "down to the hedge, where she paused and took a survey. All\n",
    "quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out of sight,\n",
    "and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a\n",
    "thin hand at the upper window.\n",
    "‘There he is,’ thought Jo, ‘Poor boy! All alone and sick this\n",
    "dismal day. It’s a shame! I’ll toss up a snowball and make him\n",
    "look out, and then say a kind word to him.’\n",
    "Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once,\n",
    "showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big\n",
    "eyes brightened and the mouth began\n",
    "to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and flourished her broom as\n",
    "she called out...\n",
    "82\n",
    "‘How do you do? Are you sick?’\n",
    "Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a\n",
    "raven...\n",
    "‘Better, thank you. I’ve had a bad cold, and been shut up a\n",
    "week.’\n",
    "‘I’m sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?’ ‘Nothing. It’s dull\n",
    "as tombs up here.’\n",
    "‘Don’t you read?’\n",
    "‘Not much. They won’t let me.’ ‘Can’t somebody read to you?’\n",
    "‘Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don’t interest him, and\n",
    "I hate to ask Brooke all the time.’\n",
    "‘Have someone come and see you then.’\n",
    "‘There isn’t anyone I’d like to see. Boys make such a row, and\n",
    "my head is weak.’\n",
    "‘Isn’t there some nice girl who’d read and amuse you?\n",
    "Girls are quiet and like to play nurse.’ ‘Don’t know any.’\n",
    "‘You know us,’ began Jo, then laughed and stopped. ‘So I do!\n",
    "Will you come, please?’ cried Laurie.\n",
    "‘I’m not quiet and nice, but I’ll come, if Mother will let me. I’ll go\n",
    "ask her. Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.’\n",
    "83\n",
    "With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the\n",
    "house, wondering what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a\n",
    "flutter of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew\n",
    "about to get ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was ‘a little\n",
    "gentleman’. and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his\n",
    "curly pate, putting on a fresh color, and trying tidy up the room,\n",
    "which in spite of half a dozen servants, was anything but neat.\n",
    "Presently there came a loud ring, than a decided voice, asking\n",
    "for ‘Mr. laurie’, and a surprised- looking servant came running\n",
    "up to announce a young lady.\n",
    "‘All right, show her up, it’s Miss Jo, ‘said Laurie, going to the\n",
    "door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy\n",
    "and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and\n",
    "Beth’s three kittens in the other.\n",
    "‘Here I am, bag and baggage,’ she said briskly. ‘Mother sent her\n",
    "love, and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted\n",
    "me to bring some of her blancmange, she makes it very nicely,\n",
    "and Beth thought her cats would be comforting. I knew you’d\n",
    "laugh at them, but I couldn’t refuse, she was so anxious to do\n",
    "something.’\n",
    "It so happened that Beth’s funny loan was just the thing, for in\n",
    "laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew\n",
    "sociable at once.\n",
    "84\n",
    "‘That looks too pretty to eat,’ he said, smiling with pleasure, as\n",
    "Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blancmange,\n",
    "surrounded by a garland of green leaves, and the scarlet\n",
    "flowers of Amy’s pet geranium.\n",
    "‘It isn’t anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it.\n",
    "Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It’s so simple you can\n",
    "eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore\n",
    "throat. What a cozy room this is!’\n",
    "‘It might be it it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I\n",
    "don’t know how to make them mind. It worries me though.’\n",
    "‘I’ll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the\n",
    "hearth brushed, so—and the things made straight on the\n",
    "mantelpiece, so—and the books put here, and the bottles there,\n",
    "and your sofa turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up\n",
    "a bit. Now then, you’re fixed.’\n",
    "And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked\n",
    "things into place and given quite a different air to the room.\n",
    "Laurie watched her in respectful silence, and\n",
    "when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat down with a sigh of\n",
    "satisfaction, saying gratefully...\n",
    "‘How kind you are! Yes, that’s what it wanted. Now please take\n",
    "the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.’\n",
    "85\n",
    "‘No, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?’ and Jo looked\n",
    "affectionately toward some inviting books near by.\n",
    "‘Thank you! I’ve read all those, and if you don’t mind, I’d rather\n",
    "talk,’ answered Laurie.\n",
    "‘Not a bit. I’ll talk all day if you’ll only set me going.\n",
    "Beth says I never know when to stop.’\n",
    "‘Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and\n",
    "sometimes goes out with a little basket?’ asked Laurie with\n",
    "interest.\n",
    "‘Yes, that’s Beth. She’s my girl, and a regular good one she is,\n",
    "too.’\n",
    "‘The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I\n",
    "believe?’\n",
    "Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, ‘Why, you see I often\n",
    "hear you calling to one another, and when I’m alone up here, I\n",
    "can’t help looking over at your house, you always seem to be\n",
    "having such good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude,\n",
    "but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the\n",
    "window where the flowers are.\n",
    "And when the lamps are lighted, it’s like looking at a picture to\n",
    "see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother. Her\n",
    "86\n",
    "face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I\n",
    "can’t help watching it. I haven’t got any mother, you know.’ And\n",
    "Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he\n",
    "could not control.\n",
    "The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo’s warm\n",
    "heart. she had been so simply taught that there was no\n",
    "nonsense in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and\n",
    "frank as any child. Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how\n",
    "rich she was in home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it\n",
    "with him. Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice\n",
    "unusually gentle as she said...\n",
    "‘We’ll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to\n",
    "look as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping,\n",
    "you’d come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she’d do you\n",
    "heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to,\n",
    "and Amy would dance. Meg and I would make you laugh over\n",
    "our funny stage properties, and we’d have jolly times. Wouldn’t\n",
    "your grandpa let you?’\n",
    "‘I think he would, if your mother asked him. He’s very kind,\n",
    "though he does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty\n",
    "much, only he’s afraid I might be a bother to strangers,’ began\n",
    "Laurie, brightening more and more.\n",
    "87\n",
    "‘We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn’t think\n",
    "you’d be a bother. We want to know you, and I’ve been trying to\n",
    "do it this ever so long. We haven’t been here a great while, you\n",
    "know, but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but\n",
    "you.’\n",
    "‘You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn’t mind\n",
    "much what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn’t stay\n",
    "here, you know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I\n",
    "just stop at home and get on as I can.’\n",
    "‘That’s bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting\n",
    "everywhere you are asked, then you’ll have plenty of friends,\n",
    "and pleasant places to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won’t\n",
    "last long if you keep going.’\n",
    "Laurie turned red again, but wasn’t offended at being accused\n",
    "of bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was\n",
    "impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were\n",
    "meant.\n",
    "‘Do you like your school?’ asked the boy, changing the subject,\n",
    "after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo\n",
    "looked about her, well pleased.\n",
    "88\n",
    "‘Don’t go to school, I’m a businessman—girl, I mean. I go to\n",
    "wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,’\n",
    "answered Jo.\n",
    "Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but\n",
    "remembering just in time that it wasn’t manners to make too\n",
    "many inquiries into people’s affairs, he shut it again, and looked\n",
    "uncomfortable.\n",
    "Jo liked his good breeding, and didn’t mind having a laugh at\n",
    "Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety\n",
    "old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the\n",
    "library where she reveled.\n",
    "Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the\n",
    "prim old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in\n",
    "the middle of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to\n",
    "his great dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran\n",
    "down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what\n",
    "was the matter.\n",
    "‘Oh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please,’ he said,\n",
    "taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with\n",
    "merriment.\n",
    "Much elated with her success, Jo did ‘tell on’, all about their\n",
    "plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most\n",
    "interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived.\n",
    "Then they got to talking about books, and to\n",
    "89\n",
    "Jo’s delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she\n",
    "did, and had read even more than herself.\n",
    "‘If you like them so much, come down and see ours.\n",
    "Grandfather is out, so you needn’t be afraid,’ said Laurie,\n",
    "getting up.\n",
    "‘I’m not afraid of anything,’ returned Jo, with a toss of the\n",
    "head.\n",
    "‘I don’t believe you are!’ exclaimed the boy, looking at her with\n",
    "much admiration, though he privately thought she would have\n",
    "good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she\n",
    "met hem in some of his moods.\n",
    "The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie\n",
    "led the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine\n",
    "whatever struck her fancy. And so, at last they came to the\n",
    "library, where she clapped her hands and pranced, as she\n",
    "always did when especially delighted. It was lined with books,\n",
    "and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little\n",
    "cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow chairs,\n",
    "and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open\n",
    "fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.\n",
    "‘What richness!’ sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour\n",
    "chair and gazing about her with an air of intense\n",
    "90\n",
    "satisfaction. ‘Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest\n",
    "boy in the world,’ she added impressively.\n",
    "‘A fellow can’t live on books,’ said Laurie, shaking his head as he\n",
    "perched on a table opposite.\n",
    "Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming\n",
    "with alarm, ‘Mercy me! It’s your grandpa!’\n",
    "‘Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,’\n",
    "returned the boy, looking wicked.\n",
    "‘I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don’t know why I\n",
    "should be. Marmee said I might come, and I don’t think you’re\n",
    "any the worse for it,’ said Jo, composing herself, though she\n",
    "kept her eyes on the door.\n",
    "‘I’m a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I’m\n",
    "only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. It was so\n",
    "pleasant, I couldn’t bear to stop,’ said Laurie gratefully.\n",
    "‘The doctor to see you, sir,’ and the maid beckoned as she\n",
    "spoke.\n",
    "‘Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see\n",
    "him,’ said Laurie.\n",
    "‘Don’t mind me. I’m happy as a cricket here,’ answered\n",
    "Jo.\n",
    "Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her\n",
    "91\n",
    "own way. She was standing before a fine portrait of the\n",
    "old gentleman when the door opened again, and without\n",
    "turning, she said decidedly, ‘I’m sure now that I shouldn’t be\n",
    "afraid of him, for he’s got kind eyes, though his mouth is grim,\n",
    "and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own. He isn’t\n",
    "as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.’\n",
    "‘Thank you, ma’am,’ said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to\n",
    "her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.\n",
    "Poor Jo blushed till she couldn’t blush any redder, and her heart\n",
    "began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had\n",
    "said. For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but\n",
    "that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she\n",
    "resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. A\n",
    "second look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy\n",
    "eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones, and there\n",
    "was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal.\n",
    "The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said\n",
    "abruptly, after the dreadful pause, ‘So you’re not afraid of me,\n",
    "hey?’\n",
    "‘Not much, sir.’\n",
    "‘And you don’t think me as handsome as your grandfather?’\n",
    "‘Not quite, sir.’\n",
    "92\n",
    "‘And I’ve got a tremendous will, have I?’\n",
    "‘I only said I thought so.’\n",
    "‘But you like me in spite of it?’ ‘Yes, I do, sir.’\n",
    "That answer pleased the old gentleman. He gave a short laugh,\n",
    "shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin,\n",
    "turned up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying\n",
    "with a nod, ‘You’ve got your grandfather’s spirit, if you haven’t\n",
    "his face. He was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was\n",
    "a brave and an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend.’\n",
    "‘Thank you, sir,’ And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it\n",
    "suited her exactly.\n",
    "‘What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?’ was the\n",
    "next question, sharply put.\n",
    "‘Only trying to be neighborly, sir.’ And Jo to how her visit came\n",
    "about.\n",
    "‘You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?’\n",
    "‘Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him\n",
    "good perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if\n",
    "we could, for we don’t forget the splendid Christmas present\n",
    "you sent us,’ said Jo eagerly.\n",
    "‘Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy’s affair. How is the poor woman?’\n",
    "93\n",
    "‘Doing nicely, sir.’ And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told\n",
    "all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested\n",
    "richer friends than they were.\n",
    "‘Just her father’s way of doing good. I shall come and see your\n",
    "mother some fine day. Tell her so. There’s the tea bell, we have it\n",
    "early on the boy’s account. Come down and go on being\n",
    "neighborly.’\n",
    "‘If you’d like to have me, sir.’\n",
    "‘Shouldn’t ask you, if I didn’t.’ And Mr. Laurence offered her his\n",
    "arm with old-fashioned courtesy.\n",
    "‘What would Meg say to this?’ thought Jo, as she was marched\n",
    "away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself\n",
    "telling the story at home.\n",
    "‘Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?’ said the\n",
    "old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought\n",
    "up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in\n",
    "arm with his redoubtable grandfather.\n",
    "‘I didn’t know you’d come, sir,’ he began, as Jo gave him a\n",
    "triumphant little glance.\n",
    "‘That’s evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your\n",
    "tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman.’ And having pulled the\n",
    "94\n",
    "boy’s hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while\n",
    "Laurie went through a series of\n",
    "comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\n",
    "explosion of laughter from Jo.\n",
    "The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups\n",
    "of tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted\n",
    "away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not\n",
    "escape him. There was color, light, and life in the boy’s face\n",
    "now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.\n",
    "‘She’s right, the lad is lonely. I’ll see what these little girls can do\n",
    "for him,’ thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He\n",
    "liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to\n",
    "understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one\n",
    "herself.\n",
    "If the Laurences had been what Jo called ‘prim and poky’, she\n",
    "would not have got on at all, for such people always made her\n",
    "shy and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so\n",
    "herself, and made a good impression. When they rose she\n",
    "proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show\n",
    "her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been\n",
    "lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as she\n",
    "went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on\n",
    "95\n",
    "either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful\n",
    "vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the\n",
    "finest flowers till his hands were full. Then he tied them up,\n",
    "saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, ‘Please give these to\n",
    "your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very\n",
    "much.’\n",
    "They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great\n",
    "drawing room, by Jo’s attention was entirely absorbed by a\n",
    "grand piano, which stood open.\n",
    "‘Do you play?’ she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\n",
    "expression.\n",
    "‘Sometimes,’ he answered modestly.\n",
    "‘Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.’ ‘Won’t you\n",
    "first?’\n",
    "‘Don’t know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.’\n",
    "So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously\n",
    "buried in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect and regard for\n",
    "the ‘Laurence’ boy increased very much, for he played\n",
    "remarkably well and didn’t put on any airs. She wished Beth\n",
    "could hear him, but she did not say so, only praised him till he\n",
    "was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue.\n",
    "96\n",
    "‘That will do, that will do, young lady. too many sugarplums are\n",
    "not good for him. His music isn’t bad, but I hope he will do as\n",
    "well in more important things.\n",
    "Going? well, I’m much obliged to you, and I hope you’ll come\n",
    "again. My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor Jo.’\n",
    "He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not\n",
    "please him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she\n",
    "had said something amiss. He shook his head.\n",
    "‘No, it was me. He doesn’t like to hear me play.’ ‘Why not?’\n",
    "‘I’ll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can’t.’\n",
    "‘No need of that. I am not a young lady, and it’s only a step.\n",
    "Take care of yourself, won’t you?’\n",
    "‘Yes, but you will come again, I hope?’\n",
    "‘If you promise to come and see us after you are well.’ ‘I will.’\n",
    "‘Good night, Laurie!’ ‘Good night, Jo, good night!’\n",
    "When all the afternoon’s adventures had been told, the family\n",
    "felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something\n",
    "very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge.\n",
    "Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who\n",
    "had not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory,\n",
    "97\n",
    "Beth sighed for the grand piano. and Amy was eager to see the\n",
    "fine pictures and statues.\n",
    "‘Mother, why didn’t Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?’\n",
    "asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.\n",
    "‘I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie’s\n",
    "father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the\n",
    "old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and\n",
    "accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son\n",
    "after he married. They both died when Laurie was a little child,\n",
    "and then his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who\n",
    "was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of\n",
    "losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally\n",
    "by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his\n",
    "grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. At any\n",
    "rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so\n",
    "he ‘glowered’ as Jo said.’\n",
    "‘Dear me, how romantic!’ exclaimed Meg.\n",
    "‘How silly!’ said Jo. ‘Let him be a musician if he wants to, and\n",
    "not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to\n",
    "go.’\n",
    "98\n",
    "‘That’s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty\n",
    "manners, I suppose. Italians are always nice,’ said Meg, who\n",
    "was a little sentimental.\n",
    "‘What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never\n",
    "spoke to him, hardly,’ cried Jo, who was not sentimental.\n",
    "‘I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows\n",
    "how to behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine\n",
    "Mother sent him.’\n",
    "‘He meant the blanc mange, I suppose.’ ‘How stupid you are,\n",
    "child! He meant you, of course.’\n",
    "‘Did he?’ And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to\n",
    "her before.\n",
    "‘I never saw such a girl! You don’t know a compliment when you\n",
    "get it,’ said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all\n",
    "about the matter.\n",
    "‘I think they are great nonsense, and I’ll thank you not to be silly\n",
    "and spoil my fun. Laurie’s a nice boy and I like him, and I won’t\n",
    "have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such\n",
    "rubbish. We’ll all be good to him because he hasn’t got any\n",
    "mother, and he may come over and see us, mayn’t he,\n",
    "Marmee?’\n",
    "99\n",
    "‘Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will\n",
    "remember that children should be children as long as they can.’\n",
    "‘I don’t call myself a child, and I’m not in my teens yet,’\n",
    "observed Amy. ‘What do you say, Beth?’\n",
    "‘I was thinking about our ‘PILGRIM’S PROGRESS’,’ answered\n",
    "Beth, who had not heard a word. ‘How we got out of the Slough\n",
    "and through the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up\n",
    "the steep hill by trying, and that maybe the house over there,\n",
    "full of splendid things, is going to be our Palace Beautiful.’\n",
    "‘We have got to get by the lions first,’ said Jo, as if she rather\n",
    "liked the prospect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "100\n",
    "C H A P T E R VI\n",
    "The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some\n",
    "time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the\n",
    "lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had\n",
    "called, said something funny or kind to each one of the girls,\n",
    "and talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much\n",
    "afraid of him, except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that\n",
    "they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of\n",
    "accepting favors which they could not return. But, after a while,\n",
    "they found that he considered them the benefactors, and could\n",
    "not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March’s\n",
    "motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he\n",
    "took in that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their\n",
    "pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think\n",
    "which was the greater.\n",
    "All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the\n",
    "new friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked\n",
    "Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that ‘the Marches\n",
    "were regularly splendid girls.’ With the delightful enthusiasm of\n",
    "youth, they took the solitary boy\n",
    "into their midst and made much of him, and he found\n",
    "something very charming in the innocent companionship of\n",
    "101\n",
    "these simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or\n",
    "sisters, he was quick to feel the influences they brought about\n",
    "him, and their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the\n",
    "indolent life he led. He was tired of books, and found people so\n",
    "interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very\n",
    "unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always playing truant and\n",
    "running over to the Marches’.\n",
    "‘Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,’\n",
    "said the old gentleman. ‘The good lady next door says he is\n",
    "studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and\n",
    "exercise. I suspect she is right, and that I’ve been coddling the\n",
    "fellow as if I’d been his grandmother. Let him do what he likes,\n",
    "as long as he is happy. He can’t get into mischief in that little\n",
    "nunnery over there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than\n",
    "we can.’\n",
    "What good times they had, to be sure. Such plays and tableaux,\n",
    "such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in\n",
    "the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the\n",
    "great house. Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she\n",
    "liked and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library\n",
    "voraciously, and convulsed\n",
    "102\n",
    "the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and\n",
    "enjoyed beauty to her heart’s content, and Laurie played ‘lord\n",
    "of the manor’ in the most delightful style.\n",
    "But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck\n",
    "up courage to go to the ‘Mansion of Bliss’, as Meg called it. She\n",
    "went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of\n",
    "her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy\n",
    "eyebrows, and said ‘Hey!’ so loud, that he frightened her so\n",
    "much her ‘feet chattered on the floor’, she never told her\n",
    "mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there\n",
    "any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or\n",
    "enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr.\n",
    "Laurence’s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending\n",
    "matters. During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led\n",
    "the conversation to music, and talked away about great singers\n",
    "whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told such\n",
    "charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay in her\n",
    "distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if fascinated. At\n",
    "the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her\n",
    "great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of\n",
    "this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if\n",
    "she\n",
    "103\n",
    "had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie’s lessons\n",
    "and teachers. And presently, as if the idea had just occurred to\n",
    "him, he said to Mrs. March...\n",
    "‘The boy neglects his music now, and I’m glad of it, for he was\n",
    "getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use.\n",
    "Wouldn’t some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it\n",
    "now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma‘am?’\n",
    "Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly\n",
    "together to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible\n",
    "temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid\n",
    "instrument quite took her breath away. Before Mrs. March could\n",
    "reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile...\n",
    "‘They needn’t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For\n",
    "I’m shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is\n",
    "out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing\n",
    "room after nine o’clock.’\n",
    "Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak,\n",
    "for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. ‘Please, tell\n",
    "the young ladies what I say, and if they don’t care to come,\n",
    "why, never mind.’ Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth\n",
    "looked up at him with a\n",
    "face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...\n",
    "104\n",
    "‘Oh sir, they do care, very very much!’ ‘Are you the musical girl?’\n",
    "he asked, without any startling ‘Hey!’ as he looked down at her\n",
    "very kindly.\n",
    "‘I’m Beth. I love it dearly, and I’ll come, if you are quite sure\n",
    "nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,’ she added, fearing to\n",
    "be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\n",
    "‘Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so come\n",
    "and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to\n",
    "you.’\n",
    "‘How kind you are, sir!’\n",
    "Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she\n",
    "was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze\n",
    "because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he\n",
    "had given her. The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her\n",
    "forehead, and, stooping down, he kissed herr, saying, in a tone\n",
    "few people ever heard...\n",
    "‘I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my\n",
    "dear! Good day. madam.’ And away he went, in a great hurry.\n",
    "Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to\n",
    "impart the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls\n",
    "were not home. How blithely she sang that evening, and how\n",
    "they all laughed at her because she woke Amy in the night by\n",
    "105\n",
    "playing the piano on her face in her sleep. Next day, having\n",
    "seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house, Beth,\n",
    "after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and\n",
    "made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room\n",
    "where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some pretty,\n",
    "easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and\n",
    "frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the\n",
    "great instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and\n",
    "everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music\n",
    "gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved friend.\n",
    "She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she\n",
    "had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in\n",
    "a general state of beatitude.\n",
    "After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge\n",
    "nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by\n",
    "a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. She never knew that\n",
    "Mr. Laurence opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned\n",
    "airs he liked. She never saw\n",
    "Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She\n",
    "never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which\n",
    "she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit,\n",
    "and when he talked to her about music at home, she only\n",
    "thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much.\n",
    "106\n",
    "So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what isn’t always the\n",
    "case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped. Perhaps it\n",
    "was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater\n",
    "was given her. At any rate she deserved both. ‘Mother, I’m\n",
    "going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so kind to\n",
    "me, I must thank him, and I don’t know any other way. Can I do\n",
    "it?’ asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\n",
    "‘Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of\n",
    "thanking him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay\n",
    "for the making up,’ replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar\n",
    "pleasure in granting Beth’s requests because she so seldom\n",
    "asked anything for herself.\n",
    "After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern\n",
    "was chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A\n",
    "cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground\n",
    "was pronounced very appropriate and pretty, and beth worked\n",
    "away early and late, with\n",
    "occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little\n",
    "needlewoman, and they were finished before anyone got tired\n",
    "of them. Then she wrote a short, simple note, and with Laurie’s\n",
    "help, got them smuggled onto the study table one morning\n",
    "before the old gentleman was up.\n",
    "107\n",
    "When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would\n",
    "happen. All day passed a a part of the next before any\n",
    "acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she\n",
    "had offended her crochety friend. On the afternoon of the\n",
    "second day, she went out to do an errand, and give poor\n",
    "Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As she came up the\n",
    "street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads popping in\n",
    "and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\n",
    "several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...\n",
    "‘Here’s a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read\n",
    "it!’\n",
    "‘Oh, Beth, he’s sent you...’ began Amy, gesticulating with\n",
    "unseemly energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by\n",
    "slamming down the window.\n",
    "Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her sisters\n",
    "seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\n",
    "pointing and all saying at once, ‘Look there! Look there!’ Beth\n",
    "did look, and turned pale with delight\n",
    "and surprise, for there stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter\n",
    "lying on the glossy lid, directed like a sign board to ‘Miss\n",
    "Elizabeth March.’\n",
    "108\n",
    "‘For me?’ gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she\n",
    "should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing\n",
    "altogether.\n",
    "‘Yes, all for you, my precious! Isn’t it splendid of him? Don’t you\n",
    "think he’s the dearest old man in the world? Here’s the key in\n",
    "the letter. We didn’t open it, but we are dying to know what he\n",
    "says,’ cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.\n",
    "‘You read it! I can’t, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!’ and Beth\n",
    "hid her face in Jo’s apron, quite upset by her present.\n",
    "Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first worked\n",
    "she saw were...\n",
    "‘Miss March: ‘Dear Madam—’ ‘How nice it sounds! I wish\n",
    "someone would write to me so!’ said Amy, who thought the oldfashioned address very elegant.\n",
    "‘‘I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had\n",
    "any that suited me so well as yours, ‘’ continues Jo. ‘‘Heartsease\n",
    "is my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the\n",
    "gentle giver. I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow ‘the\n",
    "old gentleman’ to send you\n",
    "something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he\n",
    "lost. With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain ‘‘Your\n",
    "grateful friend and humble servant, ‘‘JAMES LAURENCE’\n",
    "109\n",
    "‘There, Beth, that’s an honor to be proud of, I’m sure! Laurie told\n",
    "me how fond Mr.Laurence used to be of the child who died, and\n",
    "how he kept all her little things carefully. Just think, he’s given\n",
    "you her piano. That comes of having big blue eyes and loving\n",
    "music,’ said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked\n",
    "more excited than she had ever been before.\n",
    "‘See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green\n",
    "sild, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty\n",
    "rack and stool, all complete,’ added Meg, opening the\n",
    "instrument and displaying its beauties.\n",
    "‘‘Your humble servant, James Laurence’. Only think of his\n",
    "writing that to you. I’ll tell the girls. They’ll think it’s splendid,’\n",
    "said Amy, much impressed by the note.\n",
    "‘Try it, honey. Let’s hear the sound of the baby pianny,’ said\n",
    "Hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and\n",
    "sorrows.\n",
    "So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most\n",
    "remarkable piano ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned\n",
    "and put in apple- pie order, but, perfect as it was, I\n",
    "think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which\n",
    "leaned over it, as Beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and\n",
    "white keys and pressed the bright pedals.\n",
    "110\n",
    "‘You’ll have to go and thank him,’ said Jo, by way of a joke, for\n",
    "the idea of the child’s really going never entered her head.\n",
    "‘Yes, I mean to. I guess I’ll go no, before I get frightened\n",
    "thinking about it.’ And, to the utter amazement of the\n",
    "assembled family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden,\n",
    "through the hedge, and in at the Laurences’ door.\n",
    "‘Well, I wish I may die if it ain’t the queerest thing I ever see!\n",
    "The pianny has turned her head! She’d never have gone in her\n",
    "right mind,’ cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were\n",
    "rendered quite speechless by the miracle.\n",
    "They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what\n",
    "Beth did afterward. If you will believe me, she went and\n",
    "knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think,\n",
    "and when a gruff voice called out, ‘come in!’ she did go in, right\n",
    "up to Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out\n",
    "her hand, saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, ‘I came\n",
    "to thank\n",
    "you, sir, for...’ But she didn’t finish, for he looked so friendly that\n",
    "she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost\n",
    "the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and\n",
    "kissed him.\n",
    "111\n",
    "If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old\n",
    "gentleman wouldn’t have been more astonished. But he liked it.\n",
    "Oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly! And was so touched and\n",
    "pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness\n",
    "vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his wrinkled\n",
    "cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little\n",
    "grand daughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him from that\n",
    "moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had\n",
    "known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude can\n",
    "conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her\n",
    "own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he\n",
    "marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like a\n",
    "handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.\n",
    "When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig,\n",
    "by way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the\n",
    "window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted\n",
    "hands, ‘Well, I do believe the world is coming to an end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "112\n",
    "C H A P T E R VII\n",
    "‘That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn’t he?’ said Amy one day, as\n",
    "Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as\n",
    "he passed.\n",
    "‘How dare you say so, when he’s got both his eyes? And very\n",
    "handsome ones they are, too,’ cried Jo, who resented any\n",
    "slighting remarks about her friend.\n",
    "‘I didn’t day anything about his eyes, and I don’t see why you\n",
    "need fire up when I admire his riding.’\n",
    "‘Oh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she\n",
    "called him a Cyclops,’ exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.\n",
    "‘You needn’t be so rude, it’s only a ‘lapse of lingy’, as Mr. Davis\n",
    "says,’ retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. ‘I just wish I had\n",
    "a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,’ she added, as\n",
    "if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.\n",
    "‘Why?’ asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh\n",
    "at Amy’s second blunder.\n",
    "‘I need it so much. I’m dreadfully in debt, and it won’t be my\n",
    "turn to have the rag money for a month.’\n",
    "‘In debt, Amy? What do you mean?’ And Meg looked sober.\n",
    "113\n",
    "‘Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can’t pay\n",
    "them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my\n",
    "having anything charged at the shop.’\n",
    "‘Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be\n",
    "pricking bits of rubber to make balls.’ And Meg tried to keep her\n",
    "countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.\n",
    "‘Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you\n",
    "want to be thought mean, you must do it too. It’s nothing but\n",
    "limes now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in\n",
    "schooltime, and trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper\n",
    "dolls, or something else, at recess. If one girl likes another, she\n",
    "gives her a lime. If she’s mad with her, she eats one before her\n",
    "face, and doesn’t offer even a suck. They treat by turns, and\n",
    "I’ve had ever so many but haven’t returned them, and I ought\n",
    "for they are debts of honor, you know.’\n",
    "‘How much will pay them off and restore your credit?’ asked\n",
    "Meg, taking out her purse.’\n",
    "‘A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for\n",
    "a treat for you. Don’t you like limes?’\n",
    "‘Not much. You may have my share. Here’s the money. Make it\n",
    "last as long as you can, for it isn’t very plenty, you know.’\n",
    "114\n",
    "‘Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket money! I’ll\n",
    "have a grand feast, for I haven’t tasted a lime this week. I felt\n",
    "delicate about taking any, as I couldn’t return them, and I’m\n",
    "actually suffering for one.’\n",
    "Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the\n",
    "temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brownpaper parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of\n",
    "her desk. During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy\n",
    "March had got twenty- four delicious limes (she ate one on the\n",
    "way) and was going to treat circulated through her ‘set’, and\n",
    "the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming. Katy\n",
    "Brown invited her to her next party on the spot. Mary Kinglsey\n",
    "insisted on lending her her watch till recess, and Jenny Snow, a\n",
    "satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her\n",
    "limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to\n",
    "furnish answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not\n",
    "forgotten Miss Snow’s cutting remarks about ‘some persons\n",
    "whose noses were not too flat to smell other people’s limes, and\n",
    "stuck-up people who were not too proud to ask for them’, and\n",
    "she instantly crushed ‘that Snow girl’s’ hopes by the withering\n",
    "telegram, ‘You needn’t be so polite all of a sudden, for you\n",
    "won’t get any.’\n",
    "115\n",
    "A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that\n",
    "morning, and Amy’s beautifully drawn maps received praise,\n",
    "which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and\n",
    "caused Miss March to assume the airs of a studious young\n",
    "peacock. But, alas, alas! Pride goes before a fall, and the\n",
    "revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success. No\n",
    "sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and\n",
    "bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking an\n",
    "important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy\n",
    "March had pickled limes in her desk.\n",
    "Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and\n",
    "solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was\n",
    "found breaking the law. This much-enduring man had\n",
    "succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy\n",
    "war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and\n",
    "newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had\n",
    "forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures,\n",
    "and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred\n",
    "rebellious girls in order. Boys are trying enough to human\n",
    "patience, goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so,\n",
    "especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no\n",
    "more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis knew any\n",
    "quantity\n",
    "116\n",
    "of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called\n",
    "a fine teacher, and manners, morals, feelings, and examples\n",
    "were not considered of any particular importance. It was a\n",
    "most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny\n",
    "knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that\n",
    "morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his\n",
    "neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he\n",
    "felt he deserved. Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant,\n",
    "language of a schoolgirl, ‘He was as nervous as a witch and as\n",
    "cross as a bear\". The word ‘limes’ was like fire to powder, his\n",
    "yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with an energy\n",
    "which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.\n",
    "‘Young ladies, attention, if you please!’\n",
    "At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,\n",
    "gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful\n",
    "countenance.\n",
    "‘Miss March, come to the desk.’\n",
    "Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear\n",
    "oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.\n",
    "‘Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,’ was the\n",
    "unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of\n",
    "her seat.\n",
    "117\n",
    "‘Don’t take all.’ whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great\n",
    "presence of mind.\n",
    "Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down\n",
    "before Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human\n",
    "heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose.\n",
    "Unfortunately, Mr. Davis particularly detested the odor of the\n",
    "fashionable pickle, and disgust added to his wrath.\n",
    "‘Is that all?’\n",
    "‘Not quite,’ stammered Amy. ‘Bring the rest immediately.’\n",
    "With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed. ‘You are sure\n",
    "there are no more?’\n",
    "‘I never lie, sir.’\n",
    "‘So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and\n",
    "throw them out of the window.’\n",
    "There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust,\n",
    "as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their\n",
    "longing lips. Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro\n",
    "six dreadful times, and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so\n",
    "plump and juicy, fell from\n",
    "her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the\n",
    "anguish of the girls, for it told them that their feast was being\n",
    "118\n",
    "exulted over by the little Irish children, who were their sworn\n",
    "foes. This—this was too much. All flashed indignant or appealing\n",
    "glances at the inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime lover\n",
    "burst into tears.\n",
    "As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous\n",
    "‘Hem!’ and said, in his most impressive manner...\n",
    "‘Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I\n",
    "am sorry this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be\n",
    "infringed, and I never break my word. Miss March, hold out your\n",
    "hand.’\n",
    "Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an\n",
    "imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she\n",
    "could not utter. She was rather a favorite with ‘old Davis’, as, of\n",
    "course, he was called, and it’s my private belief that he would\n",
    "have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible\n",
    "young lady had not found vent in a hiss. That hiss, faint as it\n",
    "was, irritated the irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit’s\n",
    "fate.\n",
    "‘Your hand, Miss March!’ was the only answer her mute appeal\n",
    "received, and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth,\n",
    "threw bach her head defiantly, and\n",
    "119\n",
    "bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm.\n",
    "They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no difference\n",
    "to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck, and the\n",
    "disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her\n",
    "down.\n",
    "‘You will now stand on the platform till recess,’ said Mr. Davis,\n",
    "resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.\n",
    "That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her\n",
    "seat, and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied\n",
    "ones of her few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that\n",
    "shame fresh upon her, seemed impossible, and for a second she\n",
    "felt as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break\n",
    "her heart with crying. A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of\n",
    "Jenny Snow helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious\n",
    "place, she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now\n",
    "seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and\n",
    "white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic\n",
    "figure before them.\n",
    "During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and\n",
    "sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never\n",
    "forgot. To others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but\n",
    "to her it was a hard experience, for during the\n",
    "120\n",
    "twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone,\n",
    "and a blow of that sort had never touched her before. The smart\n",
    "of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the\n",
    "sting of the thought, ‘I shall have to tell at home, and they will\n",
    "be so disappointed in me!’\n",
    "The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at\n",
    "last, and the word ‘Recess!’ had never seemed so welcome to\n",
    "her before.\n",
    "‘You can go, Miss March,’ said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,\n",
    "uncomfortable.\n",
    "He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as\n",
    "she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom,\n",
    "snatched her things, and left the place ‘forever,’ as she\n",
    "passionately declared to herself. She was in a sad state when\n",
    "she got home, and when the older girls arrived, some time later,\n",
    "an indignation meeting was held at once. Mrs. March did not\n",
    "say much but looked disturbed, and comforted her afflicted\n",
    "little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the insulted\n",
    "hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even her beloved\n",
    "kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo wrathfully\n",
    "proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and Hannah\n",
    "shook her fist at the ‘villain’ and pounded potatoes for dinner as\n",
    "if she had him under her pestle.\n",
    "121\n",
    "No notice was taken of Amy’s flight, except by her mates, but\n",
    "the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite\n",
    "benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before\n",
    "school closed, Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression as she\n",
    "stalked up to the desk, and delivered a letter from her mother,\n",
    "then collected Amy’s property, and departed, carefully scraping\n",
    "the mud from her boots on the door mat, as if she shook that\n",
    "dust of the place off her feet.\n",
    "‘Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to\n",
    "study a little every day with Beth,’ said Mrs. March that evening.\n",
    "‘I don’t approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I\n",
    "dislike Mr. Davis’s manner of teaching and don’t think the girls\n",
    "you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall ask your\n",
    "father’s advice before I send you anywhere else.’\n",
    "‘That’s good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old\n",
    "school. It’s perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,’\n",
    "sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.\n",
    "‘I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and\n",
    "deserved some punishment for disobedience,’ was the severe\n",
    "reply, which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected\n",
    "nothing but sympathy.\n",
    "‘Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole\n",
    "school?’ cried Amy.\n",
    "122\n",
    "‘I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,’ replied\n",
    "her mother, ‘but I’m not sure that it won’t do you more good\n",
    "than a molder method. You are getting to be rather conceited,\n",
    "my dear, and it is quite time you set about correcting it. You\n",
    "have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of\n",
    "parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not\n",
    "much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked\n",
    "long, even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it\n",
    "well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is\n",
    "modesty.’\n",
    "‘So it is!’ cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo.\n",
    "‘I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for\n",
    "music, and she didn’t know it, never guessed what sweet little\n",
    "things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn’t have\n",
    "believed it if anyone had told her.’\n",
    "‘I wish I’d known that nice girl. Maybe she would have helped\n",
    "me, I’m so stupid,’ said Beth, who stood beside him, listening\n",
    "eagerly.\n",
    "‘You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else\n",
    "could,’ answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous\n",
    "meaning in his merry black eyes that\n",
    "Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face in the sofa\n",
    "cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\n",
    "123\n",
    "Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth,\n",
    "who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her\n",
    "compliment. So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being\n",
    "in a particularly lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom\n",
    "showed the moody side of his character. When he was gone,\n",
    "amy, who had been pensive all evening, said suddenly, as if\n",
    "busy over some new idea, ‘Is Laurie an accomplished boy?’\n",
    "‘Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent.\n",
    "He will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,’ replied her\n",
    "mother.\n",
    "‘And he isn’t conceited, is he?’ asked Amy.\n",
    "‘Not in the least. That is why he is so charming and we all like\n",
    "him so much.’ ‘I see. It’s nice to have accomplishments and be\n",
    "elegant, but not to show off or get perked up,’ said Amy\n",
    "thoughtfully.\n",
    "‘These things are always seen and felt in a person’s manner and\n",
    "conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to\n",
    "display them,’ said Mrs. March.\n",
    "‘Any more than it’s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns\n",
    "and ribbons at once, that folks may know\n",
    "you’ve got them,’ added Jo, and the lecture ended in a laugh.\n",
    "124\n",
    "C H A P T E R VIII\n",
    "‘Girls, where are you going?’ asked Amy, coming into their room\n",
    "one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go\n",
    "out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.\n",
    "‘Never mind. Little girls shouldn’t ask questions,’ returned Jo\n",
    "sharply.\n",
    "Now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we are\n",
    "young, it is to be told that, and to be bidden to ‘run away, dear’\n",
    "is still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and\n",
    "determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour.\n",
    "Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she\n",
    "said coaxingly, ‘Do tell me! I should think you might let me go,\n",
    "too, for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven’t got\n",
    "anything to do, and am so lonely.’\n",
    "‘I can’t, dear, because you aren’t invited,’ began Meg, but Jo\n",
    "broke in impatiently, ‘Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all.\n",
    "You can’t go, Amy, so don’t be a baby and whine about it.’\n",
    "‘You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You\n",
    "were whispering and laughing together on the\n",
    "sofa last night, and you stopped when I came in. Aren’t you\n",
    "going with him?’\n",
    "125\n",
    "‘Yes, we are. Now do be still, and stop bothering.’\n",
    "Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan\n",
    "into her pocket.\n",
    "‘I know! I know! You’re going to the theater to see the SEVEN\n",
    "CASTLES!’ she cried, adding resolutely, ‘and I shall go, for\n",
    "Mother said I might see it, and I’ve got my rag money, and it\n",
    "was mean not to tell me in time.’\n",
    "‘Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,’ said Meg\n",
    "soothingly. ‘Mother doesn’t wish you to go this week, because\n",
    "your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy\n",
    "piece. Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a\n",
    "nice time.’\n",
    "‘I don’t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie.\n",
    "Please let me. I’ve been sick with this cold so long, and shut up,\n",
    "I’m dying for some fun. Do, Meg! I’ll be ever so good,’ pleaded\n",
    "Amy, looking as pathetic as she could.\n",
    "‘Suppose we take her. I don’t believe Mother would mind, if we\n",
    "bundle her up well,’ began Meg.\n",
    "‘If she goes I shan’t, and if I don’t, Laurie won’t like it, and it will\n",
    "be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I\n",
    "should think she’d hate to poke herself where she isn’t wanted,’\n",
    "said Jo crossly, for she disliked the\n",
    "126\n",
    "trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy\n",
    "herself.\n",
    "Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots\n",
    "on, saying, in her most aggravating way, ‘I shall go. Meg says I\n",
    "may, and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn’t anything to do with\n",
    "it.’\n",
    "‘You can’t sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you\n",
    "mustn’t sit alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will\n",
    "spoil our pleasure. Or he’ll get another seat for you, and that\n",
    "isn’t proper when you weren’t asked. You shan’t stir a step, so\n",
    "you may just stay where you are,’ scolded Jo, crosser than ever,\n",
    "having just pricked her finger in her hurry.\n",
    "Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and\n",
    "Meg to reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the\n",
    "two girls hurried down, leaving their sister wailing. For now and\n",
    "then she forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled\n",
    "child. Just as the party was setting out, Amy called over the\n",
    "banisters in a threatening tone, ‘You’ll be sorry for this, Jo\n",
    "March, see if you ain’t.’\n",
    "‘Fiddlesticks!’ returned Jo, slamming the door.\n",
    "They had a charming time, for THE SEVEN CASTLES OF THE\n",
    "DIAMOND LAKE was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could\n",
    "wish. But in spite of the\n",
    "127\n",
    "comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and\n",
    "princesses, Jo’s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it. The fairy\n",
    "queen’s yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts\n",
    "she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to\n",
    "make her ‘sorry for it’. She and Amy had had many lively\n",
    "skirmishes in the course of their lives, for both had quick\n",
    "tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused. Amy\n",
    "teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and semioccasional explosions\n",
    "occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward.\n",
    "Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had hard\n",
    "times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting\n",
    "her into trouble. Her anger never lasted long, and having\n",
    "humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to\n",
    "do better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo\n",
    "into a fury because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo\n",
    "tried desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always\n",
    "ready to flame up and defeat her, and it took years of patient\n",
    "effort to subdue it.\n",
    "When they got home, they found amy reading in the parlor. She\n",
    "assumed an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes\n",
    "from her book, or asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity\n",
    "might have conquered resentment, if Beth had not been there\n",
    "to inquire and receive a glowing\n",
    "128\n",
    "description of the play. On going up to put away her best hat,\n",
    "Jo’s first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel\n",
    "Amy had soothed her feelings by turning Jo’s top drawer upside\n",
    "down on the floor. Everything was in its place, however, and\n",
    "after a hasty glance into her various closets, bags, and boxes,\n",
    "Jo decided that Amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.\n",
    "There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery\n",
    "which produced a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting\n",
    "together, late in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room,\n",
    "looking excited and demanding breathlessly, ‘Has anyone taken\n",
    "my book?’\n",
    "Meg and Beth said, ‘No.’ at once, and looked surprised. Amy\n",
    "poked the fire and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise and was\n",
    "down upon her in a minute.\n",
    "‘Amy, you’ve got it!’ ‘No, I haven’t.’\n",
    "‘You know where it is, then!’ ‘No, I don’t.’\n",
    "‘That’s a fib!’ cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking\n",
    "fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.\n",
    "‘It isn’t. I haven’t got it, don’t know where it is now, and don’t\n",
    "care.’\n",
    "129\n",
    "‘You know something about it, and you’d better tell at once, or\n",
    "I’ll make you.’ And Jo gave her a slight shake.\n",
    "‘Scold as much as you like, you’ll never see your silly old book\n",
    "again,’ cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.\n",
    "‘why not?’\n",
    "‘I burned it up.’\n",
    "‘What! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and\n",
    "meant to finish before Father got home? Have you really\n",
    "burned it?’ said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and\n",
    "her hands clutched Amy nervously.\n",
    "‘Yes, I did! I told you I’d make you pay for being so cross\n",
    "yesterday, and I have, so..’\n",
    "Amy got no farther, for Jo’s hot temper mastered her, and she\n",
    "shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a\n",
    "passion of grief and anger...\n",
    "‘You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I’ll never\n",
    "forgive you as long as I live.’\n",
    "Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was\n",
    "quite beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister’s ear,\n",
    "she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and\n",
    "finished her fight alone.\n",
    "The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and,\n",
    "having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the\n",
    "wrong she had done her sister. Jo’s book was\n",
    "130\n",
    "the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her family as a\n",
    "literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen little\n",
    "fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her\n",
    "whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good\n",
    "enough to print. She had just copied them with great care, and\n",
    "had destroyed the old manuscript, so that Amy’s bonfire had\n",
    "consumed the loving work of several years. It seemed a small\n",
    "loss to others, but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity, and she felt\n",
    "that it never could be made up to her. Beth mourned as for a\n",
    "departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her pet. Mrs. March\n",
    "looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would love\n",
    "her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now\n",
    "regretted more than any of them.\n",
    "When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and\n",
    "unapproachable that it took all Amy’s courage to say meekly...\n",
    "‘Please forgive me, Jo. I’m very, very sorry.’\n",
    "‘I never shall forgive you,’ was Jo’s stern answer, and from that\n",
    "moment she ignored Amy entirely.\n",
    "No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all\n",
    "had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood\n",
    "words were wasted, and the wisest course was to wait till some\n",
    "little accident, or her own generous\n",
    "131\n",
    "nature, softened Jo’s resentment and healed the breach. It was\n",
    "not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their\n",
    "mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth,\n",
    "something was wanting, and the sweet home peace was\n",
    "disturbed. They felt this most when singing time came, for Beth\n",
    "could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone, and Amy broke\n",
    "down, so Meg and Mother sang alone. But in spite of their\n",
    "efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not seem\n",
    "to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.\n",
    "As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered\n",
    "gently, ‘My dear, don’t let the sun go down upon your anger.\n",
    "Forgive each other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow.’\n",
    "Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and\n",
    "cry her grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly\n",
    "weakness, and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn’t\n",
    "quite forgive yet. So she winked hard, shook her head, and said\n",
    "gruffly because Amy was listening, ‘It was an abominable thing,\n",
    "and she doesn’t deserve to be forgiven.’\n",
    "With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or\n",
    "confidential gossip that night.\n",
    "132\n",
    "Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been\n",
    "repulsed, and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to\n",
    "feel more injured than ever, and to plume herself on her superior\n",
    "virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating. Jo still\n",
    "looked like a thunder cloud, and nothing went well all day. It\n",
    "was bitter cold in the morning, she dropped her precious\n",
    "turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack of the fidgets,\n",
    "Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful when\n",
    "she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who\n",
    "were always talking about being good and yet wouldn’t even try\n",
    "when other people set them a virtuous example. ‘Everybody is\n",
    "so hateful, I’ll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always kind and\n",
    "jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,’ said Jo to herself, and\n",
    "off she went.\n",
    "Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an\n",
    "impatient exclamation.\n",
    "‘There! She promised I should go next time, for this is the last\n",
    "ice we shall have. But it’s no use to ask such a crosspatch to\n",
    "take me.’\n",
    "‘Don’t say that. You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive\n",
    "the loss of her precious little book, but I think she might do it\n",
    "now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,’ said\n",
    "Meg. ‘Go after them. Don’t say\n",
    "133\n",
    "anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, than take a\n",
    "quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I’m\n",
    "sure she’ll be friends again with all her heart.’\n",
    "‘I’ll try,’ said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to\n",
    "get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing\n",
    "over the hill.\n",
    "It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy\n",
    "reached them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back. Laurie\n",
    "did not see, for he was carefully skating along the shore,\n",
    "sounding the ice, for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap.\n",
    "‘I’ll go on to the first bend, and see if it’s all right before we\n",
    "begin to race,’ Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like\n",
    "a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.\n",
    "Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and\n",
    "blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo\n",
    "never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking\n",
    "a bitter, unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister’s troubles. She\n",
    "had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession\n",
    "of her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out\n",
    "at once. As Laurie turned the bend, he shouted back...\n",
    "‘Keep near the shore. It isn’t safe in the middle.’ Jo heard, but\n",
    "Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. Jo\n",
    "134\n",
    "glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was\n",
    "harboring said in her ear...\n",
    "‘No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of\n",
    "herself.’\n",
    "Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn,\n",
    "and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the the smoother ice in\n",
    "the middle of the river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange\n",
    "feeling in her heart, then she resolved to go on, but something\n",
    "held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw up her\n",
    "hands and go down, with a sudden crash of rotten ice, the\n",
    "splash of water, and a cry that made Jo’s heart stand still with\n",
    "fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone. She tried\n",
    "to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in\n",
    "them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring\n",
    "with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the\n",
    "black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie’s voice\n",
    "cried out...\n",
    "‘Bring a rail. Quick, quick!’\n",
    "How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she\n",
    "worked as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite\n",
    "self-possessed, and lying flat, held\n",
    "135\n",
    "Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged a rail from\n",
    "the fence, and together they got the child out, more frightened\n",
    "than hurt.\n",
    "‘Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can. Pile our\n",
    "things on her, while I get off these confounded skates,’ cried\n",
    "Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the\n",
    "straps which never seemed so intricate before.\n",
    "Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after\n",
    "an exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a\n",
    "hot fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown\n",
    "about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress\n",
    "torn, and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and\n",
    "refractory buckles. When Amy was comfortably asleep, the\n",
    "house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed, she called Jo to\n",
    "her and began to bind up the hurt hands.\n",
    "‘Are you sure she is safe?’ whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at\n",
    "the golden head, which might have been swept away from her\n",
    "sight forever under the treacherous ice.\n",
    "‘Quite safe, dear. she is not hurt, and won’t even take cold, I\n",
    "think, you were so sensible in covering and getting her home\n",
    "quickly,’ replied her mother cheerfully.\n",
    "136\n",
    "‘Laurie did it all. I only let her go. Mother, if she should die, it\n",
    "would be my fault.’ And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a\n",
    "passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly\n",
    "condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her\n",
    "gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might\n",
    "have come upon her. ‘It’s my dreadful temper! I try to cure it, I\n",
    "think I have, and then it breaks out worse than ever. OH,\n",
    "Mother, what shall I do? What shall I do?’ cried poor Jo, in\n",
    "despair.\n",
    "‘Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think\n",
    "it is impossible to conquer your fault,’ said Mrs. March, drawing\n",
    "the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so\n",
    "tenderly that Jo cried even harder.\n",
    "‘You don’t know, you can’t guess how bad it is! It seems as if I\n",
    "could do anything when I’m in a passion. I get so savage, I\n",
    "could hurt anyone and enjoy it. I’m afraid I shall do something\n",
    "dreadful some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate\n",
    "me. Oh, Mother, help me, do help me!’\n",
    "‘I will, my child, I will. Don’t cry so bitterly, but remember this\n",
    "day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know\n",
    "another like it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far\n",
    "greater than yours, and it often takes\n",
    "137\n",
    "us all our lives to conquer them. You think your temper is the\n",
    "worst in the world, but mine used to be just like it.’\n",
    "‘Yours, Mother? Why, you are never angry!’ And for the moment\n",
    "Jo forgot remorse in surprise.\n",
